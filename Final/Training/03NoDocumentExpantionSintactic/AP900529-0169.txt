An explosion blasted a natural gas well Tuesday in southeastern Mississippi, killing at least one worker and critically burning four others, authorities said 
A two-mile area around the well was evacuated, affecting about 145 people 
Authorities initially evacuated only those within a half-mile, but expanded the plan after the fire went out by itself and then re-ignited, for fear that winds would scatter poisonous hydrogen sulfide gas 
The gas is naturally associated with some gas fields 
Experts at capping gas wells were to fly in Tuesday night 
The explosion occurred at about 2 p.m., authorities said 
The rig collapsed in the initial burst of what sounded like four successive explosions, said Alex Thomas, who lives within a half-mile of the rig 
Others said there was another explosion later in the afternoon 
Jim Maher, director of the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency in Jackson, said officials intended to keep the gas escaping from the well afire to burn off the poison 
 What they are going to do is bring a flame thrower-type device to keep the well burning,  Maher said 
Roads were closed leading to the well, which is about 75 miles southeast of Jackson, as was a five-mile stretch of U.S. Highway 11 
 Until we get a firm handle on this and somebody that can tell us with absolute certainty what is going on there, we will continue to take extreme precautions,  said Mississippi Emergency Management Agency spokesman Dusty Perkins 
Perkins said the rig was known as Travis No. 3 and was owned by R&H Oil and Gas Inc. of Tickfaw, La. 
City Clerk Debbie Logan identified the dead man as Dwayne Kennedy of Heidelberg 
His age and exact job were unavailable 
The four burn victims were in critical condition and would be moved to burn units in Greenville and in Mobile, Ala., said Lafe Jones, a spokesman for the South Central Regional Medical Center in Laurel 
A fifth worker was treated for minor injuries and released
