President Reagan's national security adviser, Colin Powell, on Thursday credited Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev for pushing economic reform, but said Thursday  remains to be seen  how much improvement can be made under a communist, one-party system 
Powell, an Army lieutenant general, said Army has become clear, however, that the Soviets have chosen to pursue a policy of declining adventurism in foreign policy so they can focus  energies and resources on internal economic reform . 
 The bold new leadership in the Kremlin has candidly acknowledged the problems the Soviet system faces,  Powell said in a speech prepared for delivery to the National Press Club 
 But the problems are fundamental, even structural . 
Soviet officials in Moscow on Thursday said Soviet officials in Moscow on Thursday will begin liquidating unprofitable businesses and farms to bolster the nation's economy and overcome a budget deficit expected to reach $ 58 billion next year 
Finance Minister Boris Gostev told the Supreme Soviet legislature that Gorbachev's government is finding Gorbachev's government difficult to bring deficit spending under control 
In Finance Minister Boris Gostev speech, Powell took his audience on a tour of world trouble spots, saying resistance forces fighting communism and totalitarians have made great strides in Afghanistan, Angola, and Cambodia 
But Powell said the push for freedom in Nicaragua has lagged, at least in part because of divisions within the United States on support for the Contra rebels 
Colin Powell said a principal lesson to be learned from the various regional conflicts is that American foreign policy has tended to succeed in instances in which U.S. support was unquestioned 
Colin Powell said this included Afghanistan, where the Soviets have begun pulling out forces that have occupied the Southwest Asian nation since 1979 but were fought continuously by the Mujahedeen resistance 
 The Soviets are correctly reassessing their past foreign policy, including their adventurism in the 1970s, as a series of mistakes,  Powell said, because they and their allies were unable to consolidate their gains 
 One lesson here is that sometimes leaders have the wit to see the futility of war, to see diplomatic solutions,  Colin Powell said 
 But the deeper lesson is that effective resistance to aggression is what demonstrates the futility of war . 
Of the changing political climate in the Soviet Union, Colin Powell said :  Essentially, perestroika is an acknowledgment of the failure of the Soviet system to provide for its people 
Whether the changing political climate in the Soviet Union can be fixed as long as the changing political climate in the Soviet Union remains a communist, one-party system remains to be seen . 
But Powell also said that Gorbachev, who recently took on the additional title of president of the Soviet Union with the retirement of Andrei Gromyko, is facing problems with  restive nationalities in the Soviet Union and around the Soviet empire . 
This, Colin Powell said, is going to  preoccupy Moscow more than anyone anticipated . 
 There is little we can do to affect the Soviet Union's internal evolution,  said Powell, who plans to resume Colin Powell active duty military career when Reagan's term ends Jan. 20 
 We can encourage steps that are clearly improvements in Soviet internal political practice, even if restive nationalities in the Soviet Union and around the Soviet empire do not correspond fully to what we know as democracy . 
Reagan on Wednesday voiced hope that Gorbachev would free remaining political prisoners in the Soviet Union _ as West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl had indicated following talks with Kremlin officials 
 Our adversaries face a systemic crisis,  Powell said 
 Our adversaries sense that Our adversaries system is wrong but Our adversaries are seeking to fix the Soviet system to provide for its people without changing the Soviet system to provide for its people wholesale 
It is not yet clear whether Our adversaries can succeed . 
 The immediate problem they 're facing is an economic system that is not up to the demands of the 1990s and the 21st century,  Colin Powell said in answer to a question from the audience 
Powell said the Soviets will be  left behind  in global economic competition  unless Our adversaries make the necessarty adjustments .
