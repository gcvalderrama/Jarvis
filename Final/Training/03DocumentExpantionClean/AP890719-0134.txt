Doctors Wednesday reported a growing number of stress-related illnesses among people in a resort city southwest of Tokyo that has been jolted by thousands of tremors and several volcanic eruptions in the past two weeks 
 Doctors 've had an increasing number of patients complaining of insomnia and gastritis due to stress and fear of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions,  said Mikio Kakefu, director of the National Hospital in Ito City 
Ito, a coastal resort city on the Izu peninsula, about 60 miles southwest of Tokyo, has had more than 23,000 temblors, including 486 strong enough to be felt, since June 30 
On July 13, an undersea volcano erupted off the Ito coast, creating a mound 82 feet high, according to the Maritime Safety Agency, Japan's coast guard 
Volcanic activity has slowed since then, and no strong earthquakes have been recorded since Sunday 
No injuries or damages were reported after the eruption 
But the Central Meteorological Agency has warned the volcano is likely to erupt again because the movement of magma, or molten rock, continues 
Kakefu said the hospital, which has an average of 250 outpatients daily, Monday began receiving more patients with stomach aches, insomnia and diarrhea,  all from fear and stress . 
 250 outpatients daily did n't feel sick for a couple of days after the eruption because 250 outpatients daily were still tense,  Mikio Kakefu said 
Kakefu said Mikio Kakefu does not have any statistics, but indicated the number of such patients is likely to increase 
Pets have also been developing similar symptoms since shortly after the eruption, said Masaaki Mochizuki, an Ito veterinarian 
Masaaki Mochizuki said Masaaki Mochizuki has examined 129 cats and dogs suffering the  earthquake syndrome  between July 4 and July 14 
Symptoms such as nausea, diarrhea and loss of appetite were frequent among cats, and many dogs suffered skin problems including rashes and hair loss, Masaaki Mochizuki said 
Masaaki Mochizuki said some dogs were also afflicted with coughing and trembling due to excessive fear 
 Masaaki Mochizuki busiest day was July 14, the day after the eruption,  Mochizuki said 
 Symptoms in animals appeared earlier than in people because animals are more sensitive, and people in a resort city southwest of Tokyo feel the temblors and noises more strongly . 
 people in a resort city southwest of Tokyo humans have information from the municipal office and the meteorological centers, which help to relieve people in a resort city southwest of Tokyo tensions ... but such things do n't work for animals,  Masaaki Mochizuki said
