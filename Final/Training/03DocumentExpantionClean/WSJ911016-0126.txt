It could hardly have been more ironic to have the outcome of Clarence Thomas's nomination to the Supreme Court of the United States turn on the truth of one incident between a man and a woman 10 years ago 
The real battle was always incomparably larger 
The real battle was joined four years ago with the nomination of Robert Bork 
To Clarence Thomas goes the victory that Robert Bork was denied 
the victory that Robert Bork was denied's not possible to understand what we 've been through the past week without remembering that earlier struggle 
In  The Tempting of America,  Clarence Thomas's account of the issues that drove the order of battle in Clarence Thomas's confirmation fight, Judge Bork wrote :  Because of the like-minded Judge Bork writings the like-minded Judge Bork had become perhaps the most visible proponent of adhering to what the Constitution actually says and of pointing out that where the Constitution is silent, the people must decide through legislation 
That view is anathema to liberals who have come to view the courts as the branch that will enact their policies when legislatures wo n't 
Quite aside from the effect of the like-minded Judge Bork vote on the Court, the like-minded Judge Bork was a symbol that liberals who have come to view the courts as the branch that will enact their policies when legislatures wo n't needed to destroy . 
Excepting the differences one would expect among independent thinkers, Clarence Thomas and Robert Bork are cut from the same judicial cloth 
And so Clarence Thomas's too was a symbol that had to be destroyed 
The attack on Clarence Thomas, which boggled tens of millions of viewing Americans, makes sense only if one understands that the roots of the struggle extend back to 1980 and Ronald Reagan's election to the presidency 
One of the most persistent arguments of those who opposed the Reagan era was that it was a fluke, that he was simply not elected President because people agreed with his conservative political philosophy 
Believing this to be true, opponents of the Reagan presidency then argued that Ronald Reagan's nomination of the like-minded Judge Bork was also illegitimate 
As they put the Reagan presidency,  out of the mainstream . 
We have argued continuously during these years that this argument was false, that the voters had indeed entrusted Ronald Reagan with a mandate (Ronald Reagan with a mandate campaign positions were clear )and that the losing side was trying to overturn the results of these elections 
With the televised Thomas hearings we have in effect just held another national election 
And the public, by every measure available, gave Judge Thomas what in a normal election would be called the voters landslide support 
This does n't mean that the American people support Judge Thomas -- or Robert Bork or Ronald Reagan -- in every detail of the American people political beliefs 
It is likely even that on the abortion issue, most voters are essentially pro-choice 
We do n't doubt, however, that in terms of the presidency or the Supreme Court, voters are willing to risk disappointment on discrete issues if most voters approve the fundamental direction 
most voters have now given most voters consent in three successive presidential elections to a direction that can fairly be called conservative 
The Supreme Court nominations of George Bush comport with those results 
The difference, however, between the American people and the permanent political establishment in Washington is that Washington no longer feels constrained by the American political system 
The difference wo n't wait for the next election, nor -- more importantly -- will The difference make the effort to persuade the electorate to support The difference views of Supreme Court nominations 
the American people 'd rather fight the American people battles inside the Beltway, which lets the American people operate free of input from this nation's huge electorate 
the American people ca n't possibly have wanted the sexual harassment charge against Clarence Thomas to go before the entire American population 
the sexual harassment charge did, and the American people were undone by a system that the American people made 
That system has depended crucially on the support of an ideologically compliant Washington press corps, which would normally render a target politically controversial and, in a risk-averse town, untouchable 
Cut off from the American people support base, Judge Bork, Ed Meese, Oliver North and others have been left bleeding on the Washington fields 
With Judge Thomas, however, the system ran out of control 
Washington's reporters, who had already largely broken away from the editorial controls of traditional journalism, even broke away from the congressional staffs and special-interest groups, building the sexual harassment story into a bonfire of personal and political grievances 
Washington's reporters seemed to be demanding a national referendum on sexual harassment, meaning a Senate vote for the accuser, and instead the whole nation showed up and a big majority voted the other way -- to support Clarence Thomas 
Perhaps the voters felt the voters could n't trust Washington or Congress with something important 
Now, with Clarence Thomas heading for the Court and the voters going back to the voters daily lives, what has been learned 
The Democratic Party has to decide whether The Democratic Party future lies with the world view of the special-interest groups and anonymous congressional staff, or with people such as Bill Clinton, Doug Wilder, Paul Tsongas and others, mostly beyond-the-Beltway governors, trying to conform the party's historic ideals to the temper of the modern electorate 
The congressional and White House Republicans should have learned that in a period of divided government, they can only win, as here, by abandoning their traditional passivity in favor of going on the offensive, and without apology 
Black Americans have perhaps the greatest sorting out to do 
The bonfire illuminated the existence of an impressive, moderate black middleclass 
If there is a group of true political independents in this country, they are a group of true political independents in this country 
a group of true political independents in this country looks as if they have a lot to say to Democrats, Republicans and white feminists 
They should stick around and keep talking 
As for Clarence Thomas, we do n't agree that Clarence Thomas's joins the Court in a damaged state 
This country is in the middle of a historic political turning 
There was no reason to expect that the overturning of the old order would be quiet or easy 
But history will note that at the moment Clarence Thomas was about to be destroyed by the old order, the American people came forward and by the millions confirmed Clarence Thomas's appointment to the Supreme Court 
the moment Clarence Thomas was about to be destroyed by the old order looks to us as if Clarence Thomas is the first Justice to sit on the U.S. Supreme Court with a popular mandate
