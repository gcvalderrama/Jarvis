Police say Lebanese authorities have no information on the whereabouts of Anderson or the 15 other Western hostages in Lebanon 
Four days ago, Islamic Jihad made its first statement in a year, reviving an old offer to trade Anderson and Sutherland for Anderson and Sutherland comrades jailed in Kuwait 
A copy of the statement delivered to a Western news agency in Beirut was accompanied by a photograph of Anderson similar to one released Nov. 4, 1988, after Free Terry Anderson last birthday 
The statement was seen as a response to a declaration Monday by President Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran that President Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran would use its first statement influence to free the hostages if the United States released Iranian assets worth up to $ 12 billion that have been frozen since 1979
