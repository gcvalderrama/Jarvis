Patten Poses Seven Challenges to China in Second Annual Report -- Patten's New Tactics and Challenges to China 1 
Abandoning Christopher Patten  from politics to politics  stance, which is that politics is self-justifying and self-sufficient, Patten has now woven politics into the lives of the people of Hong Kong, making stance , which is that politics is self-justifying and self-sufficient part and parcel of the local way of life and inseparable from the war on corruption, the rule of law, freedom, education, and the quality of governance -- all  perennial concerns  in Chinese society 
-LSB- passage omitted -RSB- The way Christopher Patten talked last year, you would have thought Christopher Patten were in Britain 
Now Patten takes life in Hong Kong as Christopher Patten point of departure, arguing that democratic politics of a high quality are what the people of Hong Kong need to maintain the  Hong Kong system . 
How can the Chinese authorities be persuasive if the Chinese authorities reject his argument 
What alternative can the Chinese offer 
If the Chinese come up with the Chinese authorities own agenda, what must China in Second Annual Report -- Patten's New Tactics and Challenges to China 1 contain that would invalidate the British position 
How to sever the linkage between  politics  and the  Hong Kong way of life ? 
When Hong Kong fought for democracy in the 1980's, Xu Jiatun -LSB- 6079 1367 1470 -RSB- tried countering Hong Kong's capitalist primary democracy with advanced socialist democracy 
Subsequently China rejected Hong Kong's political demands by questioning the Chinese authorities timetable 
After Patten came to Hong Kong, the Chinese could no longer keep acting anti-democratic 
All the Chinese authorities could do was to declare that the Chinese authorities too were for democracy but that the dispute between China and Britain is not one over the extent of democracy but one involving trust between two nations 
Now that Patten has made politics an integral part of the life of the Hong Kong people and the Hong Kong people institutions, can the Chinese continue to counter China in Second Annual Report -- Patten's New Tactics and Challenges to China 1 with the argument that China in Second Annual Report -- Patten's New Tactics and Challenges to China 1 is all a matter of trust between nations

In contrast to Christopher Patten past arrogance and wilfulness, Patten now says,  Christopher Patten have grown to like Hong Kong more and more 
Christopher Patten have deep feelings for this place . 
Christopher Patten hopes that  as this place advances with big strides into the 21st century, Hong Kong will be like a beacon, shining brightly as if to announce its glorious achievements 
this place will also set an excellent example demonstrating that in a system of freedom, people can successfully overcome all sorts of adversity and difficulties and, hand in hand, create a wonderful future . 
(Section 190 )After the governor presented After the governor first annual report to the Legislative Council last year, the Chinese authorities initially took a heavy-handed approach 
It was so severe and threatening that Section 190 gave the impression China was prepared for mutual destruction, with Britain, Hong Kong, and Britain all going down the tube 
In doing so, the Chinese only succeeded in turning public opinion strongly against the Chinese authorities 
Even as public approval of Patten slipped and opposition rose, anti-Chinese feelings in Hong Kong also gained ground 
Politically speaking, the Chinese paid dearly for opposing Patten 
At the time the Chinese could convincingly attack Patten for Christopher Patten overbearing ways, arrogant, domineering, stubborn, and intractable 
Now Patten has changed Christopher Patten attitudes 
Christopher Patten may still be impenetrably thick-headed, but Christopher Patten has mellowed considerably and become more practical 
What should be China's attitude now 
If the Chinese try to be as mellow and practical as Patten, that may be interpreted as a compromise 
Yet if they persist in their shrill ways, they may lose points 
3 
Patten's second annual report to the Legislative Council is replete with praises for the people of Hong Kong, for the Hong Kong people accomplishments, and for the superiority of the Hong Kong system, calling the superiority of the Hong Kong system a miracle of human society 
The report also contains endless comparisons with Britain, Australia, and the Netherlands, countries which the local people are familiar with 
Of course this is the stock in trade of politicians in every democratic country, but the stock in trade of politicians in every democratic country also shows that the relationship between the ruler and the ruled under a democratic system is just what the people of Hong Kong need psychologically at this point in time 
Having inherited the tradition of the Qing Dynasty and the Republic of China, the Chinese Communists have always considered Hong Kong alien land 
the tradition of the Qing Dynasty is hard for the Chinese to sing the praises of the Hong Kong system, Hong Kong people, and Hong Kong society 
During the anti-Patten campaign last year, the Chinese opposed everything that was associated with Patten 
What Patten said about Hong Kong's values and Hong Kong superiority were all satirized by the Chinese media, so much so that one could hardly tell right from wrong anymore 
The  anti-Patten  campaign came perilously close to being an  anti-Hong Kong  movement 
The objective of the Chinese was to launch an all-out attack on Patten, stopping at nothing 
In so doing, however, they in effect repudiated many of the values of the system of Hong Kong 
If China continues China in Second Annual Report -- Patten's New Tactics and Challenges to China 1 negative attitude toward Hong Kong, what sort of price will China in Second Annual Report -- Patten's New Tactics and Challenges to China 1 have to pay 
If, on the other hand, the other hand echoes Patten and begins heaping praises on Hong Kong and emulating the Hong Kong system, can the Chinese Government bring the other hand to do that 
Would praising Hong Kong send a wrong message to the local people, misleading the local people into thinking that China would compromise with Patten and go along with Christopher Patten 
Would that encourage  Hong Kong chauvinism ?

Patten has modified Christopher Patten political reform proposals in two major ways 
First, Christopher Patten has replaced functional groups with statutory bodies even as Christopher Patten insists that voting be based on the individual and reduces the overall number of voters from the 2.70 million called for last year to 1 million 
The second concession is that the electoral committee would be composed of four groups following the organizational model of the second legislative council after 1997 as spelled out in the Basic Law 
Under Patten's original proposal, the committee was to be made up of popularly elected district representatives (in its entirety or to a large extent )
Nevertheless, Patten sticks by Christopher Patten original plan to have the 400 members of the electoral committee be chosen through election 
Moreover, this concession comes with strings attached ; the proposal that elected representatives be allowed to serve out their terms beyond 1997 (the  through train  concept )is part and parcel of Christopher Patten overall plan 
Britain and China reopened negotiations in April mainly because public opinion forced popularly elected district representatives -LRB- in its entirety or to a large extent -RRB- back to the conference table 
Both sides knew full well the price of defying public wishes 
popularly elected district representatives -LRB- in its entirety or to a large extent -RRB- may not reach an agreement if popularly elected district representatives -LRB- in its entirety or to a large extent -RRB- negotiate, but popularly elected district representatives -LRB- in its entirety or to a large extent -RRB- are bound to lose if popularly elected district representatives -LRB- in its entirety or to a large extent -RRB- do n't even talk 
Hong Kong people hope that something will come out of their talks 
A dozen or so public opinion surveys by the Hong Kong Statistical and Business Research Council invariably came up with one finding : The people of Hong Kong want both sides to make concessions and reach an accord 
Now that Patten has made the first move by taking the initiative to give way, naturally the public wants the Chinese side to make corresponding concessions in order to narrow the difference between the two sides 
How should the Chinese Government respond 
If the Hong Kong people continue to insist that Patten is guilty of the  three violations  and refuse to make adjustments and concessions, the Hong Kong people would have a lot of ideological work to do on the Hong Kong people, besides giving Patten a reason to withdraw from the talks 
However, if the Hong Kong people give way, the Hong Kong people would be handing a victory to Patten 
Patten's initial demand was an electorate of 2.7 million people 
Patten's initial demand has now been scaled back to 1 million, still significantly more than the 200,000-300 ,000 people who would have been eligible to cast votes for the original 21 functional seats 
How extensive a concession should the Chinese make 
What about the  through train  proposal 
As the seven letters between the foreign ministers indicate, both sides agreed that the same electoral arrangements should remain in place from 1995 through 1999, allowing legislators elected in 1995 to serve out the foreign ministers terms through 1999 
Then came the 4 June tragedy of 1989 and the big victories scored by democratic groups in direct Legislative Council elections in 1991 
The Chinese wavered on the  through train  idea and the British came up with democratic groups in direct Legislative Council elections own set of arrangements for the 1995 elections 
Since the controversy was triggered off by China's plan to scrap the  through train  proposal, would the controversy make concessions on this very issue

Patten's second annual report to the Legislative Council was an honest self-examination of Christopher Patten past commitments regarding the people's livelihood and the work that had been done 
Christopher Patten talked about things he had accomplished and things Christopher Patten had not, laying Patten's second annual report to the Legislative Council all out in an honest, earnest, and realistic way 
One year after arriving in Hong Kong, Patten has certainly commanded much authority with Christopher Patten solid political ideas 
More than that, his skills, language, and operating method as a politician as well as the closeness between him and the public have also set a standard that the leader of the post-1997 special administrative region -LSB- SAR -RSB- must meet 
During the subsequent question period, Legislative Council members lined up to point out the errors in Christopher Patten report 
Their exchange, complete with questions, answers, charges, and explanations, was democracy in action, live 
Public statements by Chinese officials to this date still contain a lot of empty bureaucratic gobbledygook, devoid of a spirit of seeking truth from facts 
Chinese officials to this date always lecture the masses on the omnipotence, all-knowingness, invincibility, infallibility, and greatness of government, instead of talking about self-restraint, self-discipline, and self-control 
The real issues are never aired in the open 
Patten demonstrates the modern Western political approach while the Chinese remain wedded to propagating the superiority of  big, complete, and all-powerful government  going back thousands of years 
How should the Chinese respond to Patten's new methods indicative of a modern open society 
Should they throw a tantrum and pick a fight with Patten over this 
Or should they take a leaf from Patten's book and try to communicate with the masses using similar methods 
Would the SAR chief after 1997 measure up to Patten's standard 
After the June 4 incident, Deng Xiaoping raised a lot of expectations when Deng Xiaoping said that Deng Xiaoping would  get several practical things done . 
Yet no documents have ever been issued regarding the  practical issue . 
Have they really materialized 
Patten makes endless allusions to what is good about the Hong Kong system and what is bad about the Chinese system, one obvious example being the way the two governments level with the people 
Even more striking is the open dialogue and debate that took place in an atmosphere of freedom between Patten and the people of Hong Kong on an equal plane after the governor presented After the governor second annual report (in which the Chinese authorities also played an active part )
6 
For the first time, Patten devoted an entire chapter to Sino-British relations 
Christopher Patten spent a lot of time emphasizing the close ties between China and Hong Kong and the numerous connections between the two, including cooperation in administrative matters and environmental protection 
In the future, bridges of the concrete and steel variety will be built to link the two together 
Even more important will be bridges of the invisible type 
Sino-Hong Kong relations mean China learning from Hong Kong's value system and success story and Hong Kong drawing support form China's strengths 
Patten said,  When many places in the world identify with Hong Kong's value system and seek to duplicate the world success story, would the world become a better place, a more prosperous place 
Or will the world become less prosperous 
We all know the answers to these questions . 
(Section 182 )Patten took the initiative to define the relations between China and Hong Kong, giving substance to their contacts as well as clarifying the nature of such relations 
Hong Kong represents progress and as such should be imitated ; China represents power and should therefore be a source of support for Hong Kong to tap into 
Together they can take bold strides into the next century 
China has always looked at Hong Kong unilaterally from top to bottom, demanding that China in Second Annual Report -- Patten's New Tactics and Challenges to China 1 fall in line with China and not the other way round 
The kind of Sino-Hong Kong relations China wants is one in which Hong Kong complies with all China's orders and satisfies every Chinese demand 
Whatever the merits of the case, no matter who represents progress and who represents backwardness, the Chinese want Hong Kong to simply blend Hong Kong into the entity known as China 
As for making the Hong Kong system  living, automatic, and autonomous,  the relations between China and the special entity of Hong Kong, how the two should be integrated and to what extent, as well as the costs and benefits of such integration ... none of that has been considered at length 
Nor do the Chinese allow such consideration ; mention differences between the two systems and they cry  abetting,   sowing discord,   setting one party against another . 
A major incompatibility in Sino-Hong Kong relations is that the sovereign body, namely China, is large but backward, whereas Hong Kong, which has no sovereignty, is small but advanced 
A unilateral emphasis on China's sovereignty would result in integration of a regressive type, meaning that an advanced Hong Kong would have to reach down to accommodate a backward China 
A one-sided emphasis on Hong Kong's non-sovereign status is both impossible and disastrous 
How to define Sino-Hong Kong relations down to the details is a major challenge facing Hong Kong in the future 
The success or failure of this relationship will impact the relations between the mainland and Taiwan and those between the central government on the mainland and the localities (a perennial problem in Chinese politics going back thousands of years )

In his annual report to the Legislative Council, Patten noted subtly and not so subtly that where Hong Kong was free to make up Hong Kong mind, things had gone well in the past year, but where consultation with China was necessary, nothing seemed to have worked well 
In Section 172, he said . 
... outstanding achievements have been scored on all fronts during the past year ... with one lone exception,  which was Hong Kong's effort to  further the past year understanding with China  and  replace unproductive speculation with sincere trust . 
(Section 173 )Why 
 Not because of a lack of effort, a lack of determination to improve bilateral relations on Hong Kong's part . 
(Section 174 ) The reason is that we still have not been able to convince Chinese officials that Hong Kong citizens ' expectations about the development of their political system are in no way excessive but are reasonable and should be met, that Chinese officials that Hong Kong citizens ' expectations about the development of their political system are in no way excessive form part of the natural evolution of a society as part of the natural evolution of a society matures and becomes more sophisticated 
In a certain sense, political development is also a prerequisite for Hong Kong's remaining a leading player in international trade 
These expectations do not constitute a threat to China now and will not do so in the future 
The fact of the matter is that these expectations can be met within the framework of  one nation, two systems . 
(Section 175 )Instead of saying the Chinese refused to go along or disagreed, Patten said euphemistically that they (meaning Christopher Patten and Christopher Patten associates )had failed to convince Chinese officials 
In fact Christopher Patten meaning is very clear 
We all know what the problem is : The failure by the Chinese authorities to see what Patten and others have been able to see 
Cases in point : Pier No. 9, the airport, the harbor, the Sino-British liaison group 
Patten covered all these problems at great length and, in so doing, seemed to have put the ball back in China's court 
Last year the Chinese tried to shoot down Patten's political reform plan in an overbearing way by resorting to economic pressure, ready and willing to destroy all three parties 
What the Chinese wanted to prove was that Patten would not be able to accomplish a thing without China's cooperation, that Christopher Patten would end up with not just one broken leg, but two broken legs 
Basically the Chinese have achieved this goal 
On the other hand, the Chinese were also taking a risk 
The people of Hong Kong might blame the Chinese Government for the delay in solving all those problems that need to be tackled urgently 
What are the Chinese going to do about these feelings 
How to point the accusing finger back at the British 
How to undo the damage the delay has caused Hong Kong and China (particularly Guangdong )
Who should be held politically accountable 
In the second half of the year, will the Chinese continue to relax their economic austerity drive or will they tighten the belt again
