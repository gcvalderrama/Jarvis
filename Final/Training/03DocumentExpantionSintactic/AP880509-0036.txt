Separate strong earthquakes rocked northern Japan and the main Philippine island of Luzon today, swaying buildings and trees but apparently not causing any serious injuries or damage, officials said 
The Japanese quake registered a preliminary 5.2 on the Richter scale and was the second strong temblor to hit the northern island of Hokkaido in less than three days, Central Meteorological Agency officials said 
Central Meteorological Agency officials said The Japanese quake struck at 7:44 a.m. (6:44 p.m. Sunday )and was centered in the Hidaka mountain range, 45 miles away from Saturday's earthquake, which measured a preliminary 6.4 on the scale 
Local police said there were no immediate reports of damage or casualties 
The pre-dawn Philippine earthquake struck at 3:45 a.m. (3:55 p.m. Sunday )and registered a preliminary 5.4 Richter reading, the Royal Observatory of Hong Kong said 
The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology said The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology was centered 110 miles northwest of Manila under the Luzon Sea 
Earthquakes measuring 5 on the open-ended Richter scale are classified as strong and capable of causing considerable damage in populated areas 
However, both quakes were located deep below the earth's surface and therefore caused little damage, officials said 
Both earthquakes also occurred in quake-prone areas where edges of the earth's crustal plates are thought to rub together, a Central Meteorological Agency official said 
 the earth 's's been some time since officials had earthquake activity in that area of Hokkaido, so earthquake activity's not surprising to have some now caused by a build-up of pressure between the plates,  a Central Meteorological Agency official said, speaking on condition of anonymity 
The official said there was no way of knowing whether the Japanese quake was related to the one in the Philippines, 2,250 miles away 
The Philippine islands are thought to be located on the edge of a separate, smaller crustal plate which extends up to southern Japan 
Institute spokesman Ulpiano Trillanes said the Philippine earthquake affected a wide area of Luzon island, including Manila, but apparently caused no serious damage or injuries 
In the past 35 years there have been two major earthquakes in Hokkaido 
In 1968, the Tokachi-Oki earthquake measuring a 7.9 on the Richter scale killed 52 people 
The Richter scale measures the total magnitude of an earthquake 
Every increase of one digit in the scale represents a tenfold increase in magnitude, thus a reading of 4.5 would be 10 times stronger than one of 5.5
