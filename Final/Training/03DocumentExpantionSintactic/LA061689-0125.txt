Milken, 42, who has been on a leave of absence from Drexel since March 29, on Thursday submitted wizard Michael Milken resignation 
In a telephone interview, Lowell Milken said Lowell Milken new firm, International Capital Access Group, would offer a wide range of consulting services consistent with Lowell Milken personal interests and Lowell Milken previous work at Drexel 
Lowell Milken claimed that one purpose of the firm will be to  address the major issues in society . 
Lowell Milken said Lowell Milken would offer advice on subjects as diverse as the Third World debt crisis, helping unions, employees and minorities obtain ownership stakes in companies and advising financially troubled companies on how to raise new capital 
` Very Emotional Experience ' The timing of Milken's resignation appears to have been influenced by a Supreme Court decision last week that cleared the way for Drexel to complete the way announced plan to settle civil insider-trading and securities fraud charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission 
The settlement now is expected to go into effect within the next few weeks 
The settlement requires Drexel to terminate Milken's employment and also avoid any direct or indirect business dealings with Lowell Milken 
Milken's brother, Lowell Milken, 39, also resigned Thursday from Drexel 
Lowell Milken said through Lowell Milken attorney that Lowell Milken plans to resume practicing law 
Lowell Milken had been a lawyer with the Los Angeles firm of Irell & Manella before Lowell Milken left in 1978 to help Lowell Milken brother run Drexel's junk bond department 
Michael Armstrong, Lowell Milken's lawyer, said his client has n't decided yet where his client will practice 
Lowell Milken was also indicted in March on racketeering charges 
During the rare, on-the-record interview, Michael Milken said of the resignation :  After spending your whole life working for one company, ` Very Emotional Experience ' The timing of Milken's resignation's a very emotional experience . 
But in a reference to the investigation and legal problems that have beset Lowell Milken, Lowell Milken added,  the last few years have been an emotional experience . 
Milken said Lowell Milken decided to set up Lowell Milken own firm now because  to continue to help (people he has done business with or offered advice to -RRB-, Lowell Milken need some vehicle to be able to help . 
` Naturally Disappointed ' Milken started out in 1969 as a part-time employee at Drexel Harriman, a Philadelphia investment firm that was a precursor to Drexel Burnham Lambert, while attending the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business 
Within a decade, Milken started out in 1969 as a part-time employee pioneering use of high-yield, high-risk junk bonds had transformed Drexel from a second-tier brokerage firm into one of Wall Street's most powerful investment banking houses 
In a written statement issued Thursday, Milken said :  Drexel is the only company Lowell Milken 've worked for since graduating from college 
And it's the only one I ever expected to work for 
Lowell Milken am naturally disappointed to be forced to leave Drexel as part of the firm's settlement with the government, but Lowell Milken look forward to the opportunity of helping people build companies . 
Milken currently faces a 98-count federal criminal indictment 
The government is also demanding that Lowell Milken forfeit $ 1.85 billion under the racketeering charges 
Steven Anreder, Drexel's spokesman, said :  Michael Milken made many important contributions to Drexel Burnham, and Lowell Milken resignation, although not unexpected, is a sad event . 
Steven Anreder added :  Lowell Milken wish Steven Anreder , Drexel's spokesman well in Steven Anreder , Drexel's spokesman new endeavor . 
Milken was somewhat vague about exactly what the new firm will do or how many people International Capital Access Group will employ 
Lowell Milken personal spokesman, Ken Lerer, said International Capital Access Group would start out with fewer than 10 employees 
Tentative plans call for International Capital Access Group to be based in West Los Angeles, and Lerer said International Capital Access Group definitely wo n't be in the Beverly Hills building that houses Drexel's junk bond department 
Milken, Lowell Milken brother and several other partners own that building 
Declined to Speculate Milken said Lowell Milken is n't currently talking with any of Lowell Milken former colleagues at Drexel about coming to work for Lowell Milken new firm, but Lowell Milken did n't rule out that possibility 
 Lowell Milken just ca n't tell Steven Anreder at this time,  Lowell Milken said 
Lowell Milken also declined to speculate on whether Lowell Milken might try to expand the firm to offer full-scale investment banking services if Lowell Milken should succeed in overcoming the criminal and civil charges facing Lowell Milken 
 The financial world changes all the time,  Lowell Milken said 
 Exactly what one would be interested in doing in the future Lowell Milken do n't know . 
For the time being, Milken's legal problems probably will prevent Lowell Milken from competing directly with Drexel, individuals involved in the legal cases said 
Were Lowell Milken to branch out beyond consulting to underwriting or trading securities, Lowell Milken might run afoul of federal and state regulators who supervise the registration of securities broker-dealers 
But sources said the potential exists nevertheless for conflicts with Drexel 
The SEC settlement's ban on Drexel doing business either directly or indirectly with Milken could be interpreted to mean that Drexel ca n't do business with clients advised by Milken 
Milken's lawyers have n't said yet whether Milken's lawyers will challenge that provision of the settlement in court 
If provision of the settlement goes into effect, however, provision of the settlement conceivably could force clients to choose between dealing with Milken or Drexel 
A source close to Milken said :  A source think Lowell Milken 'd have to take provision of the settlement on a case-by-case basis . 
Anreder said :  Lowell Milken do n't anticipate any conflicts . 
Milken also declined to say if Lowell Milken might refer clients to firms other than Drexel for investment banking services 
 Lowell Milken ca n't predict what's going to happen in the future,  Lowell Milken said 
 clients advised by Milken 'll see what happens and the future will depend on each individual situation . 
Milken, who earned amounts ranging up to $ 550 million per year at Drexel, over the last year has attempted to help arrange financing for unions and workers seeking to take over troubled companies 
Lowell Milken also has proposed innovative solutions to the Latin American debt problem 
Some observers have viewed this as part of an overall public relations campaign at a time when Lowell Milken is in trouble 
But Lerer insists that these are all genuine interests of Milken's and that Lowell Milken has been involved in these activities for years 
` More Demands Than Ever ' Friends of Milken's have speculated that one reason Lowell Milken decided to start a new firm now is that, since taking a leave of absence from Drexel, Lowell Milken has had an unaccustomed amount of time on his hands 
Friends note that Milken typically would work from 4:30 a.m. until about 6 p.m. 
Lowell Milken was used to orchestrating a multitude of deals at once 
In recent weeks, Milken has given speeches to a variety of organizations and worked on Lowell Milken legal defense 
 a multitude of deals at once think Michael is desperate to find something to do,  a former Drexel colleague said 
Milken Lowell Milken, however, strongly denied that Lowell Milken has time on Lowell Milken hands 
 Lowell Milken have more demands on my time than ever before,  Lowell Milken said, although Lowell Milken added, referring to the legal cases :  Sometimes they 're things you 'd rather not have to spend time on . 
Gary Lynch, the SEC's director of enforcement, declined to comment Thursday on Milken's decision to open a new business 
The Milken brothers still face SEC civil charges as well as the separate criminal charges 
Milken, Lowell Milken brother and former Drexel trader Bruce L. Newberg are likely to go to trial on the pending criminal charges sometime early next year 
Federal prosecutors are expected to bring a new indictment within the next several months containing additional charges 
A number of Milken's former colleagues at Drexel already have been granted immunity from prosecution and are cooperating with the government investigation 
Sources confirmed Thursday that another former Drexel employee, Reed Harmon, who had worked closely with Milken, was recently granted immunity in exchange for testimony before a grand jury 
Charges Denied Harmon is said to have detailed knowledge of some of Milken's business dealings with former stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky 
Boesky, suspected of widespread insider trading, pleaded guilty to one criminal count and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors 
Much of the government's case against Milken involves Lowell Milken alleged dealings with Boesky 
Milken, Lowell Milken and Newberg all vigorously deny the charges against Federal prosecutors 
Drexel has agreed to plead guilty to six criminal charges and pay $ 650 million in penalties under an agreement with the U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan 
The guilty plea would be made after the firm's separate settlement with the SEC goes into effect 
Lawyers for Michael and Lowell Milken are challenging provisions of the settlement agreement, including a requirement that Drexel withhold much of the brothers ' compensation owed The Milken brothers for 1988 
Michael Milken is said to be owed at least $ 200 million
