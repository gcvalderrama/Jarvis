GOVERNOR Bill Clinton of Arkansas was gambling yesterday that an extraordinary prime-time television confession of ` wrongdoing ' in his marriage has salvaged GOVERNOR Bill Clinton of Arkansas campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination 
During a joint TV appearance with GOVERNOR Bill Clinton of Arkansas wife, Hillary, Mr Clinton admitted GOVERNOR Bill Clinton of Arkansas marriage had been rocky, but GOVERNOR Bill Clinton of Arkansas denied allegations of a 12-year-long affair with a former Arkansas state employee and part-time cabaret singer 
Ms Gennifer Flowers, the employee, last night held a news conference in New York in which Gennifer Flowers accused Mr Clinton of lying when GOVERNOR Bill Clinton of Arkansas claimed friends were just friends 
Gennifer Flowers said : ' US was Bill Clinton's lover for 12 years ... GOVERNOR Bill Clinton of Arkansas is absolutely lying 
US 'm disappointed, but realistically US never thought GOVERNOR Bill Clinton of Arkansas 'd come out and admit 12 years . 
In response to one question, Gennifer Flowers said the local Republican party in Arkansas had offered Gennifer Flowers money six months ago to reveal Gennifer Flowers affair with Mr Clinton, but Gennifer Flowers had refused 
Gennifer Flowers said Gennifer Flowers had lied to the press to protect Republican and that later Gennifer Flowers sold Gennifer Flowers story to a supermarket tabloid because Republican had angered Gennifer Flowers 
At the press conference Ms Flowers played 10 minutes of tape-recorded telephone conversation she said was between Ms Gennifer Flowers and Mr Clinton 
Published excerpts of these tapes have so far proved inconclusive and questions have surfaced about Ms Gennifer Flowers credibility 
Ms Flowers maintains Ms Gennifer Flowers met Mr Clinton in 1979 and 1980 at the Excelsior Hotel in Little Rock 
But the hotel did not open until 1982 
Ms Gennifer Flowers also claims to have reported on Mr Clinton while working with a local TV station, but Little Rock's KARK-TV said Little Rock's KARK-TV could find no tapes to support this 
Mr Clinton, the early front-runner for the Democratic nomination, was judged yesterday to have taken a huge gamble by appearing on CBS's programme ` Sixty Minutes ', which generally attracts more than 30m viewers 
Although GOVERNOR Bill Clinton of Arkansas campaign advisers said the sex scandal rumours were drowning out the Arkansas governor's message to voters, the risk was GOVERNOR Bill Clinton of Arkansas confessions could draw further media scrutiny just three weeks before the critical New Hampshire primary election 
Mr Clinton, 46, appeared calm and good-humoured throughout the interview . 
US have acknowledged causing pain in US marriage, ' GOVERNOR Bill Clinton of Arkansas said . 
US have said things to US and to the American people from the beginning that no American politician ever has . 
But in response to a question on whether no American politician had ever committed adultery, Mr Clinton avoided a clear-cut response 
` US 'm not prepared to say tonight that any married couple should ever discuss that with anyone but themselves . 
anyone but themselves appealed to the US public for fairness and urged the media to respect anyone but themselves privacy, instead of turning the 1992 campaign into a ` game of gotcha ' 
Mr Clinton saw GOVERNOR Bill Clinton of Arkansas popularity fall sharply last week among likely Democratic voters in New Hampshire, Reuter reports from Boston 
In a poll by the American Research Group, which has conducted daily surveys in advance of the February 18 primary, support for Mr Clinton fell 14 percentage points in five days last week 
The latest polling data put Mr Clinton in second place, with 25 per cent, to Mr Paul Tsongas, a former Massachusetts senator, who has 27 per cent of voters ' support
