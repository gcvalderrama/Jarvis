The mysterious geologic forces behind the current eruptions of Mt. Kilauea are quietly creating the newest piece of America 
Climbing with agonizing slowness from the warm tropical waters just southeast of the Big Island of Hawaii is an undersea mountain 
Volcanologists believe 
Loihi eventually could emerge 
as the ninth Hawaiian island 
It seems to be tapping the same source of magma (lava still underground )as Kilauea
