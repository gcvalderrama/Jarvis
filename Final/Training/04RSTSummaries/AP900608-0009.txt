Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton secured a solid majority 
But , like a boxing champion 
is being asked 
to explain the lack of a knockout punch 
to win Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton sixth straight Democratic nomination 
who slipped by on points , a boxing champion 
Clinton , 43 , was the nation's youngest governor 
when first elected in 1978 
and Bill Clinton has had a stranglehold on the state's Democratic Party ever since 
But in last week's primary , Bill Clinton garnered just 55 percent of the vote 
while Tom McRae , an unpolished campaigner 
who slipped by on points 
who heads a public policy think tank , earned 39 percent
