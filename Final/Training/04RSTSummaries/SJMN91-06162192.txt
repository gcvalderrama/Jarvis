About 15,000 U.S. service members , dependents and civilians were ordered early today 
to evacuate Clark Air Base , one of the largest U.S. bases overseas , 
after a Philippine volcano dormant for six centuries began exploding 
with searing gases , thick ash and deadly debris. ; Lt. Col. Ron Rand , a spokesman at Clark , announced at 5 a.m. 
that all non-essential personnel should begin evacuating the sprawling base 
that Americans who live on or near the base 
would drive or be bused to the U.S-operated Subic Bay Naval Base , about an hour's drive to the southwest
