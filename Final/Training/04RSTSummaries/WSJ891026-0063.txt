A volcano will erupt next month on the fabled Strip : 
the new Mirage is the most stunning example of Las Vegas's concerted effort 
a 60-foot mountain spewing smoke and flame every five minutes 
The man-made inferno will tower over a man-made lagoon with more than four acres of pools , grottoes and waterfalls 
to transform the new Mirage into a world-famous vacation resort for families as well as gamblers

Not for 15 years has a big new hotel-casino opened here 
Now the Mirage and Circus Circus Enterprises Inc.'s $ 290 million Excalibur are going up
