Beijing , February 26 (XINHUA )The recent passage of Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten's partial electoral bill by its Legislative Council (Legco )was not accidental , but long premeditated 
The step was taken in disregard of repeated persuasion by China and the aspirations of all the social strata in Hong Kong for a settlement of the electoral arrangements through talks 
Over the past two days , the British side also published a white paper 
and unilaterally made public the contents of last year's 17 rounds of Sino-British talks on the arrangements for the 1994-1995 elections in Hong Kong 
In addition , the Hong Kong Government gazetted the remaining part of Patten's reform package on Friday
