As the summer draws to the summer close , Zimbabwe's farmers are counting the cost 
Over the country as a whole , rainfall has been less than half the seasonal average ; in many southern and eastern areas , the country as a whole has been between a tenth and a third of normal levels 
of what for most of Zimbabwe's farmers is the worst drought they have ever experienced 
Crop production has been devastated , with the exception of drought-resistant tobacco , 
where output has risen 6 per cent 
to 180m kg 
Maize deliveries to the state-owned grain marketing board will fall by 90 per cent this year to 60,000 tonnes , from more than 600,000 tonnes last year and an annual average of more than 1m tonnes in the late 1980s
