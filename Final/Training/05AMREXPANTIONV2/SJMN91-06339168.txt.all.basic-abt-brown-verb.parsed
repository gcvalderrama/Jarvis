# ::snt While Sununu's lack of political skill in dealing with political Washington eventually cost John Sununu  John Sununu  job , and while John Sununu  fatal flaw may have been in believing that John Sununu  was smarter than Bush , the chief of staff was often in an inept way trying to fulfill the mandate John Sununu  had been given by John Sununu  boss. ; In many critical ways , Sununu exacerbated Bush's limitations , rather than making up for aides  , and whenever the spotlight swung away from foreign affairs , it became painfully apparent that this was a White House without a long-range agenda , without a communications strategy and without first-rate thinkers in many top jobs. ; As Bush tried to be the ultimate Washington insider , the chief of staff alienated Congress , Cabinet members , House Republicans and the press , who disdained Sununu because aides  believed John Sununu  misled aides
