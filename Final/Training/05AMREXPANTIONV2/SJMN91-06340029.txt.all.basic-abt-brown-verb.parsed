Neal addressed Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito , who set sentencing for Feb. 7 and rejected a Hodgman request to raise Keating's bail from $ 100,000 to $ 1 million. ; As Mr. Neal has indicated , there is the possibility of some imminent action on the federal front , Hodgman said in arguing that Keating was now an increased flight risk. ; Emotions ran high during the trial , which became a national window into the extravagances and duplicity that contributed to the collapse of the savings and loan industry during the freewheeling 1980s. ; Civil lawsuits contend that after buying Lincoln in 1984 , American Continental quickly and illegally began siphoning off federally insured deposits to fund a playground of lofty salaries and company-paid jet-setting for Keating , Keating's  family and top officers. ; During the trial , bondholders jeered Keating as Keating's  passed attorneys  in court hallways
