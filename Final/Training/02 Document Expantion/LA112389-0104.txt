Lincoln Savings & Loan owner Charles H. Keating Jr., his family and his family business empire poured nearly $ 350,000 into state politics during 1985 and 1986, with about half of it going to Gov. George Deukmejian's reelection campaign, contribution records show 
Along with the $ 173,000 donated to Deukmejian's campaign, Keating's family and business connections also contributed $ 176,500 over the two years to Democratic and Republican groups and such politicians as then-Assembly Republican Leader Pat Nolan of Glendale and Gray Davis in Gov. George Deukmejian's successful race for state controller 
The figures do not include at least $ 83,336 in contributions made personally or through the firms of two other Keating associates -- Los Angeles attorney Karl M. Samuelian and San Diego businessman Tom C. Stickel 
Keating hired Samuelian, the governor's chief fund raiser, to be one of his California attorneys 
the outspoken Keating also invested heavily in a San Diego company controlled by Stickel, who also was a Deukmejian fund raiser and became the Republican Party's finance co-chairman in 1987 
" Charlie Keating's political reach, in retrospect, was phenomenal, " Stickel said in a recent interview about Keating's political muscle 
The political largess in Sacramento was part of a web of influence that the blunt-talking Arizona businessman wove throughout the country to nurture and protect his ill-fated financial and investment companies, which regulators now contend inflated the value of his ill-fated financial and investment companies assets and deceived investors into buying high-risk bonds 
In April, Keating's American Continental Corp. of Phoenix filed for bankruptcy, prompting federal officials to immediately take over April subsidiary Lincoln Savings & Loan 
The move is expected to cost taxpayers $ 2 billion -- the costliest savings and loan bailout in American history 
After the seizure, the outspoken Keating candidly declared that the outspoken Keating had expected the political contributions to prod influential politicians, such as U.S. Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif . 
, to fend off hostile regulators 
" One question, among the many raised in recent weeks, had to do with whether the outspoken Keating financial support in any way influenced several political figures to take up the outspoken Keating cause, " said Keating 
" the outspoken Keating want to say in the most forceful way the outspoken Keating can, the outspoken Keating certainly hope so . 
In California, Keating hired key Deukmejian supporters or appointees to help protect Gov. George Deukmejian's ill-fated Lincoln Savings 
As attorneys, the outspoken Keating hired fund raiser Samuelian and Franklin Tom, a former state commissioner of savings and loan who left public service to join Samuelian's Los Angeles law firm 
The lawyers helped Keating obtain state permission to float more than $ 200 million in high-risk bonds, on which the outspoken Keating company subsequently defaulted 
Keating also paid $ 200,000 in 1985 for the consulting services of former Savings and Loan Commissioner Lawrence W. Taggart, who had left government service in December, 1984, for a job with TCS Enterprises of San Diego 
Days before the outspoken Keating left for TCS, Taggart approved a request by Lincoln to increase the amount of assets the institution could sink into high-risk real estate investments 
In January, 1985, when Taggart joined TCS, Keating hired Commissioner Lawrence W. Taggart as an executive and paid $ 2.89 million to buy 19.2 % of the fledgling San Diego firm's stock as the fledgling San Diego firm's stock went public 
Meanwhile, Keating and his associates were investing heavily in California state politics 
the outspoken Keating coalition of contributors included the outspoken Keating family -- son Charles Keating III and three sons-in-law -- and the outspoken Keating corporations, including American Continental, Lincoln Savings and three other subsidiaries 
The group also included eight employees and executives, such as American Continental Vice President Robert J. Kielty and consultant Taggart, as well as Phoenix business associate Conley Wolfs-winkel, who bought 6,150 acres in Tucson with American Continental in 1985 
While Keating Robert J. Kielty gave only $ 7,000 -- all of it to Deukmejian -- the coalition of the outspoken Keating relatives, business interests and associates brought total donations to $ 349,500 in 1985 and 1986 
Reports show : * Deukmejian received $ 173,000 from the Arizona businessman and Gov. George Deukmejian's associates 
The governor received $ 80,000 directly from American Continental and Lincoln Savings ; $ 19,000 from Keating and his family members ; $ 51,000 from other American Continental subsidiaries and executives ; and $ 23,000 from Keating business associates 
The governor has said that the governor's met Keating only once and never knew of Lincoln's financial woes until the outspoken Keating read about Keating and his family members in newspaper reports this year
