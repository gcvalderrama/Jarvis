British researchers have found the first unambiguous evidence that small changes in gravity can precede a volcanic eruption 
In an article published today in the journal Nature the researchers report that gravity increased at the Poas volcano in Costa Rica over a two-year period before the volcano erupted in April and May of 1989 
The increased gravity was thought to result from the intrusion of dense molten rock into the volcanic cone 
Geophysicists Helen Rymer and Geoff Brown of the Open University in Milton Keynes , England , believe that measurements of very small changes in gravity -- called microgravity -- can be used to predict eruptions of certain types of volcanoes like Poas 
Rymer speculated that Poas may erupt again next April or May 
Rymer and Brown are also now beginning to monitor microgravity at Mt. Etna in Sicily , where the population in the area is threatened by periodic eruptions 
Microgravity would seem to be a very promising technique that should be used (for predicting volcanic eruptions ), said geophysicist Dan Dzurisin of the U.S. Geological Survey's Cascades Volcano Observatory in Washington 
But the technique has yet to be tested , in part , because monitoring changes in microgravity is an extremely labor-intensive process that can not be readily automated 
As a result , most studies have measured microgravity changes only at long intervals , often simply before and after a volcanic eruption , and the results have been open to various interpretations 
The Rymer and Brown study , in which microgravity was measured at regular intervals over a 10-year period , represents the first time we can see a progression in microgravity over a long period of time so that the results are much clearer , said geologist Al Eggers of the University of Puget Sound in Tacoma , Wash. 
Measuring gravitational changes is extraordinarily exacting , Dzurisin said 
The accelerometers that are used are highly sensitive and easily get out of calibration , he said 
It is thus necessary to calibrate the instruments frequently by moving them to a site where gravity does not change , requiring a constant human presence 
The process is even more complicated because the accelerometers are sensitive to slight changes in elevation -- changes as small as fractions of an inch 
(If the device is raised an inch , for example , it is that much farther from the center of the Earth , so that the pull of gravity is slightly less )
Measurements of gravity must be accompanied by highly accurate measurements of the level of land at the measurement site so that changes in elevation -- which often occur before volcanic eruptions -- are not misinterpreted as actual changes in gravity 
Poas volcano is a classical cone-shaped volcano with a clear , deep (120 to 150 feet )lake in its center 
The lake is normally quite warm , about 104 degrees Fahrenheit , indicating that at least some molten rock lies close to the surface and heats it 
After the volcano's last eruption in 1953 , the lake filled to its normal depth and remained stable for three decades 
But in 1983 , Rymer said in a telephone interview , the lake's level began dropping slowly 
By 1987 , when Rymer and Brown began detecting an increase in microgravity , the lake level was dropping much more rapidly 
Rymer believes the molten rock , or magma , that was causing the gravity to increase was also heating the water and making it evaporate faster 
In June , 1987 , geysers of water began erupting and the water level went down even faster 
By April of this year , the water was gone and the volcano erupted in a mile-high cloud of ash 
The ash eruptions subsided when spring rains re-established the lake , Rymer said , but she believes the volcano may erupt again as the lake is depleted during the coming dry season 
The researchers do not know what happened to gravity levels after the eruption because their funding expired at about the same time the volcano erupted 
But they will go back to Costa Rica in March to take new measurements 
The lessons learned at Poas may not be applicable everywhere 
Although Japanese researchers have some preliminary evidence of increases in microgravity before volcanic eruptions , Eggers found that microgravity actually decreased at Pacayo volcano in Guatemala before an eruption 10 years ago 
Eggers speculates that the decrease was caused by formation of gaseous pockets in the magma 
Still other volcanoes monitored by Dzurisin and others have shown no apparent changes 
But it is likely , Dzurisin said , that each volcano has its own characteristic pattern of gravity changes and that once those changes are known , the pattern can be used for future predictions 
Furthermore , Rymer noted , both Poas and Mt. Etna are filled with very light material , so that the intrusion of magma is more readily detected 
In such cases , she said , gravity changes should be a particularly useful predictive tool
