Lilongwe June 6 SAPA -- Three million people will need emergency food aid in 1994/95 following widespread crop failure in central and southern Malawi , the United Nations Food Aid Organisation -LSB- FAO -RSB- said on Monday -LSB- 6 June -RSB- 
A recent FAO/World Food Programme crop assessment mission blamed the crop failure on erratic and insufficient rainfall 
This year's cereal production among smallholders is estimated to be 60 per cent less than last year's bumper harvest , and only 28 per cent higher than in 1991/92 , when drought devasted southern Africa 
The mission estimated about 493,000 tons of cereals would have to be imported 
Of the cereal food aid requirement , about 175,000 tons would be needed as emergency assistance for some three million people 
Another 270,000 tons would be required to be sold in the market to stabilise food supply and prices 
Food scarcity in the markets leads to riots , hoarding and skyrocketing prices 
That happened during the big drought of 1992 
We attach equal importance to keeping the commercial sector well-supplied , said WFP Director Phillip Ostenso 
Despite a bumper harvest last year , Malawi has not recovered from the massive 1991/92 drought 
The sharp decline in the production of major crops such as tobacco and cotton due to drought means reduced incomes for many rural households 
Malnutrition rates have always been very high in Malawi , even with good harvests 
Studies suggest more than half of rural pre-school children suffer from chronic malnutrition 
Thus food shortages and high prices can quickly aggravate an already critical situation 
Although landlocked , Malawi proved in the 1991/92 drought it was adequately equipped to handle the transportation , storage and internal distribution of large volumes of food imported through South Africa , Mozambican or , possibly , Tanzanian ports
