Anti-gun control groups and some U.S. law enforcement officials are questioning the validity of a study that says the Canadian city of Vancouver is safer than Seattle because of gun control laws 
A study to be published Thursday in the New England Journal of Medicine concludes that the number of handgun deaths in Vancouver , British Columbia , 120 miles to the north , between 1980 and 1986 was nearly one-fifth that of Seattle 
Dr. John Henry Sloan , chief investigator for the study , said 388 homicides occurred in Seattle during the study period , while 204 occurred in Vancouver 
The number of gun-related deaths in Seattle was 139 , compared with 25 for Vancouver , he said 
Sloan , 34 , a researcher at the Injury Prevention Research Center at Seattle's Harborview Medical Center , stopped short Tuesday of saying his findings prove Seattle's laxer handgun control laws cause more deaths , but said it virtually explains it 
Gun control activists were quick to seize the opportunity 
I think that the study clearly puts to rest the notion strong handgun control laws do not have an effect on levels of crime , said Susan Whitmore , spokeswoman for Washington , D.C.,-based Handgun Control Inc. 
John Hosford , executive director of the Seattle-based Citizen's Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms , dismissed the study as a political ploy to help a gun control initiative on Maryland's ballot 
It is not new research , Hosford said 
I do not think the study is valid , since it does not take into account the cause and effect of many issues 
And Dr. Paul Blackman , spokesman for the National Rifle Association in Washington , D.C. , criticized the study for not looking at the period before Vancouver's new gun control laws went into effect in 1978 
Sloan said Vancouver's laws were made stricter in 1978 , but did not change significantly 
In Seattle , handguns may legally be purchased for self defense 
After a 30-day waiting period , a permit can be obtained to carry a handgun as a concealed weapon 
Recreational uses are minimally restricted 
In Vancouver , self-defense is not considered a legal reason to purchase a handgun 
Concealed weapons are not permitted and recreational use of handguns such as target shooting and collecting are regulated by the province 
The weapons may only be fired at a licensed shooting club 
In addition , criminal offenses carry stricter penalties than in the United States , said Vancouver police Sgt. Robert Law 
Hosford said that what Seattle needs is not more gun control laws , but stricter penalties for people convicted of crimes involving guns 
Jim Deschane , commander of the Seattle police West Precinct , said he believes the process of allowing people to carry handguns in the city is far too lax because police ca not check applicantsmedical records 
Dr. Stanley Abrams , a forensic psychologist who has been involved in investigations of serial murders in Portland , Ore. , said easy availablity of guns can cause more deaths , because it is psychologically more difficult for someone to use a knife to kill than to just shoot a gun 
People who use knives have to be more destructive _ it is definitely more difficult to kill with a knife , Abrams said 
And since only 5 percent of murders are planned , a person carrying a gun makes it that much more likely a murder will occur , Abrams said
