The failed savings and loan association where Neil Bush was a director had a strict code of ethics requiring officials to avoid any action that might in any way be a conflict of interest , and the President's son ignored the rules , a federal regulator testified Wednesday 
A director is required to give full disclosure to other directors , said regulator Terry Sandefur , offering an emphatic shorthand summary of the case against Bush 
He is accused of failing to inform his colleagues on the board of Silverado Banking , Savings Loan Assn. that he had important business connections with Bill L. Walters and Kenneth M. Good , two big borrowers at Silverado 
Even if there is nothing more than an appearance of conflict of interest , the director should seek to avoid that situation , said Sandefur , the assistant deputy district director for the Office of Thrift Supervision 
The OTS is seeking a cease-and-desist order barring Bush from any future violation of conflict of interest regulations 
Because the collapse of hundreds of SLs will cost taxpayers $ 130 billion , the role of the President's son in the Silverado case is drawing nationwide attention 
His defenders portray Neil Bush , who was 30 when he joined the Silverado board in 1985 , as an honest but naive young man who is being persecuted because he is the President's son 
But federal regulators say Neil Bush was supporting Silverado financing for Good and Walters without disclosing that they were bankrolling his oil exploration business 
In addition to the OTS complaint , Bush is one of the defendants in a $ 200-million suit by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. against the Silverado directors 
Walters and Good defaulted on more than $ 130 million in loans at Silverado during the three-year period when Bush served on the board 
The Silverado code of ethics , made available by the OTS on Wednesday , said officers and directors should keep themselves free of influences that might conflict or appear to conflict with the SL's interest 
Directors also should submit annual statements covering potential conflicts of interest , and should offer special submissions if the director feels any of his activities , interests or relationships might possibly give rise to a conflict of interest , according to the Silverado ethics guide , dated April 24 , 1985 
The officer or director's statements should include any activity that might in any way be deemed to constitute a conflict of interest , the document said 
The hearing will conclude today with the long-awaited appearance of Neil Bush 
Daniel Davidson , the administrative law judge handling the case , will decide next year whether to recommend issuing the cease-and-desist order against Bush 
The final decision will be made by Timothy Ryan , the OTS director 
His ruling can be appealed to the courts
