 fill  material  light  both and  note   Poas  etna  mt. 
 Eggers  say  and   Rymer   Brown  represent  geologist 
molten rock  cause  gravity  microgravity  such case 
 Eggers  find  actual decrease   Guatemala  volcano   Pacayo 
 Dan Dzurisin  Washington  say  and  sensitive  get 
land level measurement accurate site  accompany  measurement  gravity 
 Rymer  say  begin  slow 
study  simple only measure  change  thing 
lake  fill  last eruption  volcano  normal depth 
 research  report  increase  poas volcano   Rica 
 research country  go  take   Rica
