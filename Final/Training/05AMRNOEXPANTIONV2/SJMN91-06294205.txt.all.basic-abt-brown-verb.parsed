# ::snt ; John T. Estes , president of the International Council of Cruise Lines , which represents the owners of most of the ocean-going cruise vessels , said that his organization favored all the proposed new rules , but not the proposed effective dates. ; When the safety committee met in May , it was considering phasing-in dates for the regulations beyond 1994 for new ships , possibly as late as 2010 for removal from service of vessels that can not meet the new rules. ; Estes said that accounting for the lead time required for ship design , his organization favors 1996 for enforcing the rules on new construction and major reconstruction. ; The 15 major cruise ships that call in New York have passed inspections without difficulty , according to Comdr. Anthony Dupree , chief of the inspection department of the Coast Guard in New York
