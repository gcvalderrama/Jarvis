# ::snt With his television set tuned to Cable News Network , a phone line open to the White House and an aide poised by his elbow to provide the latest economic statistics , Greenspan is playing the role of wartime Washington policy-maker to the hilt. ; Indeed , unlike his predecessor , the prickly and standoffish Paul A. Volcker , Greenspan has developed close ties to the White House and has quietly become a key economic adviser to President Bush. ; Greenspan's influence over White House economic policy became clear during President Bush's State of the Union address , when Bush announced that he was tapping Greenspan to lead a new commission to study a controversial proposal to cut the tax rate for capital gains. ; The appointment will plunge Greenspan -- himself a strong supporter of a cut in capital gains tax rates -- directly into the middle of a raging political debate between the president and Congress over tax policy. ; By any standard , Fed-watchers say Greenspan is taking on a role that is almost unprecedented in modern times

# ::snt He must still appease the hard-liners within the Fed who remain concerned about inflation. ; As a result , critics have noticed gleefully that Greenspan -- uncharacteristically , Fed-watchers say -- has made some seemingly conflicting statements on the direction of interest rates and monetary policy in recent weeks. ; I have noticed a real change in the message from one day to the next , Meltzer says. ; Still , most analysts believe that , despite the confusing message , Greenspan is now solidly in favor of easing interest rates further -- a position that clearly has made him more welcome at the White House. ; Observers note that Greenspan , who ran his own economic consulting firm before coming to the Fed to replace Volcker in 1987 , is ideally suited to the role of gray eminence -- of a senior behind-the-scenes adviser. ; In fact , he played such a role on a more official basis during the Ford administration , when he served as the president's chief economic adviser. ; It was during the Ford administration in the mid-1970s that Greenspan first came to know Bush , who served in a series of posts under Ford , including director of the Central Intelligence Agency. ; That is really his forte , providing one-on-one advice , says Robert Kavesh , an economics professor at New York University and a Greenspan friend since they were college classmates at New York University in the late 1940s. ; He is a low-key guy who is at his best in a private situations where he can quietly exchange views
