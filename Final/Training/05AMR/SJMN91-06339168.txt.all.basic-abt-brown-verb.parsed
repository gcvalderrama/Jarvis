# ::snt Sununu even tried to manipulate John Sununu boss on occasion, with the effect that Bush looked weak and waffling. ; When the glow faded from the Persian Gulf war, and the country began looking to the White House for leadership on the stagnant economy and the pain of many Americans, the president once again allowed many Americans to be guided by Sununu and many Americans closest White House ally, Richard Darman, the budget chief. ; Sununu and Darman urged the president to follow John Sununu instincts that there was nothing John Sununu could do about the economy and that John Sununu should not even try to come up with a drastic plan. ; Moreover, in the recent fiasco about caps on credit card interest rates, Sununu did something that is never done in a city that operates strictly on hierarchy : John Sununu blamed the mess on John Sununu boss, going on national television to say Bush had " ad-libbed " the idea in a speech. ; Bush appeared out of sync with the country
