# ::snt Six weeks after his beating by Los Angeles police -- and seemingly forgotten in the political turmoil that has followed -- Rodney G. King fears retribution, spends most of his time seeing doctors, and thinks a lot about the headaches, scars and facial numbness he worries might become permanent. ; A man who was always concerned about his looks, and particularly fussy about his teeth, King is depressed about his appearance and will likely need more surgery to minimize scars on the right side of his face, his plastic surgeon and ex-wife said last week
