At the White House as elsewhere , Vice President George Bush's search for a running mate has people guessing _ and now one of their own is part of the guessing game 
President Reagan says [he (PRP)| President Reagan (NNP)] is just guessing along with everybody else 
[I (PRP)| President Reagan (NNP)] do not have a candidate , [he (PRP)| President Reagan (NNP)] said Wednesday when asked about [it (PRP)| Wednesday (NNP)] 
That is up to [him (PRP)| a candidate (NN)] 
Reagan also was asked about a newspaper column suggesting [his (PRP$)| President Reagan (NNP)] national security adviser , Lt. Gen. Colin L. Powell , as a possibility for the second spot on the ticket 
Powell is the first black ever to hold the post of national security adviser 
[You (PRP)| President Reagan (NNP)] would better watch out , the president quipped 
[He (PRP)| President Reagan (NNP)] is standing right behind you 
Powell , stationed behind the group of reporters who were questioning Reagan during an Oval Office photo opportunity , made no comment 
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater , asked what [he (PRP)| Marlin Fitzwater (NNP)] thought of Powell as a vice presidential prospect , said , Colin Powell is a great American and would be an outstanding candidate for any position 
[I (PRP)| Marlin Fitzwater (NNP)] hope [he (PRP)| White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater (NNP)] is listening to this 
Fitzwater's daily briefings are piped into the offices of top White House aides 
Later , as Reagan bade farewell to visiting Icelandic Prime Minister Thorsteinn Palsson in the White House East Room , the question came up again 
Secretary of Defense Frank C. Carlucci , responding to a reporter's query , nodded toward Powell and said with a grin , [He (PRP)| an outstanding candidate for any position (NN)] is [my (PRP$)| Frank C. Carlucci (NNP)] candidate 
Powell just grinned and shook [his (PRP$)| Lt. Gen. Colin L. Powell (NNP)] head but said nothing 
Before [he (PRP)| Lt. Gen. Colin L. Powell (NNP)] went to the Pentagon , Carlucci had Powell's job , and Powell was [his (PRP$)| Lt. Gen. Colin L. Powell (NNP)] deputy 
The most recent thing Powell has said about his future was in a speech to the World Affairs Council of Los Angeles on July 19 
As for [myself (PRP)| Lt. Gen. Colin L. Powell (NNP)] , [he (PRP)| Lt. Gen. Colin L. Powell (NNP)] said , [I (PRP)| Lt. Gen. Colin L. Powell (NNP)] expect to go back to a nice quiet foxhole where [I (PRP)| Lt. Gen. Colin L. Powell (NNP)] can serve [my (PRP$)| Lt. Gen. Colin L. Powell (NNP)] country in a more comfortable and perhaps less exposed position 
Powell is an army officer and , before becoming Carlucci's deputy in January 1987 , was commanding General of V Corps in Frankfurt , West Germany 
The questions about [his (PRP$)| Lt. Gen. Colin L. Powell (NNP)] future were spurred by a column in Wednesday's Washington post by William Raspberry suggesting that it would be a brilliant idea for Bush to pick Powell as [his (PRP$)| Vice President George Bush's (NNP)] running mate 
Despite the jesting tone of the questions and answers , [it (PRP)| the jesting tone of the questions and answers (NN)] is not just a joke 
Rep. Jack Kemp , R-N.Y. , who is [himself (PRP)| Jack Kemp (NNP)] a potential vice presidential candidate , is among those who have mentioned Powell as a possible Bush running mate 
The congressman's press secretary , Marci Robinson , said Kemp believes Powell would be an exciting choice with the foreign affairs and other experience to be able to serve as president if necessary and that politically speaking , [it (PRP)| an exciting choice with the foreign affairs and other experience (NN)] would hit the Democrats at their strength 
Powell is the only current White House aide being mentioned as even a remote possibility to be Bush's running mate , although former chief of staff Howard H. Baker Jr. has been reported under consideration 
Fitzwater was asked jokingly whether [he (PRP)| Marlin Fitzwater (NNP)] is interested 
[I (PRP)| vice president (NN)] am available , [he (PRP)| vice president (NN)] replied to laughter 
[I (PRP)| vice president (NN)] ought to get the honesty vote 
[I (PRP)| vice president (NN)] say [it (PRP)| the honesty vote (NN)] right up front _ [I (PRP)| vice president (NN)] will be vice president 
Just ask 
[I (PRP)| vice president (NN)] never disparaged the job 
[I (PRP)| vice president (NN)] thought it was terrific when [I (PRP)| vice president (NN)] was on the staff 
Fitzwater was Bush's press secretary before taking [his (PRP$)| Marlin Fitzwater (NNP)] present job
