Former Rep. Thomas Ashley , a longtime friend of President Bush , confirmed today that [he (PRP)| Thomas Ashley (NNP)] is been giving advice to Neil Bush since last winter on the controversy surrounding the president son's role in the collapse of a Denver savings and loan 
But Ashley , a banking lobbyist , denied that Bush had asked [him (PRP)| the younger Bush (NNP)] to contact [his (PRP$)| the younger Bush (NNP)] son 
That is absolutely inaccurate , Ashley said in an interview 
[I (PRP)| Ashley , a banking lobbyist (NNP)] am to smart to do that 
The Denver Post reported in today's editions that Ashley , a college classmate of George Bush's from Yale , had talked to the younger Bush at the president's behest before Neil Bush was questioned by federal banking regulators 
The newspaper attributed the report to comments by Neil Bush [himself (PRP)| George Bush's from Yale (NNP)] , contained in a deposition taken by the Office of Thrift Supervision 
If Neil thinks [his (PRP$)| the younger Bush (NNP)] father called [me (PRP)| Ashley , a banking lobbyist (NNP)] , [he (PRP)| the younger Bush (NNP)] is mistaken , Ashley said 
Ashley , 67 , a Democrat , is a former congressman from Ohio 
[He (PRP)| Democrat (NNP)] is currently president of the Association of Bank Holding Companies , a banking lobbying organization based in Washington 
Neil Bush faces a public disciplinary hearing before federal regulators in September on [his (PRP$)| the younger Bush (NNP)] role as a director of the bankrupt Silverado Banking , Savings and Loan 
Ashley said that [he (PRP)| the younger Bush (NNP)] contacted Neil Bush on his own last winter after reading about [his (PRP$)| the younger Bush (NNP)] troubles in the paper 
Since then , [I (PRP)| Ashley , a banking lobbyist (NNP)] have seen Neil a half dozen times 
We talk about [it (PRP)| his own last winter (NN)] , Ashley said 
[He (PRP)| the younger Bush (NNP)] said that , although President Bush did not ask [him (PRP)| President Bush (NNP)] to contact Neil Bush , the president is aware that [he (PRP)| President Bush (NNP)] has been counselling the son 
Bush has pledged not to get personally involved in the investigation of [his (PRP$)| the younger Bush (NNP)] son 
Ashley said [I (PRP)| Ashley , a banking lobbyist (NNP)] do not think the president has any problem with the fact that [he (PRP)| the president's (NN)] has involved [himself (PRP)| the president's (NN)] in the matter 
What [he (PRP)| the president's (NN)] feels is [I (PRP)| Ashley , a banking lobbyist (NNP)] am a longtime friend of Neil's 
Is everyone who is close to the president supposed to stay away from Neil ? 
Ashley asked 
President Bush does not go along with that 
[He (PRP)| President Bush (NNP)] rejects that , Ashley said 
[I (PRP)| Ashley , a banking lobbyist (NNP)] have talked to the president (about the situation )on a couple of social occasions , when we are alone , including once at Camp David , Ashley said 
[I (PRP)| Ashley , a banking lobbyist (NNP)] talk about the kids 
Neil's one of the kids 
Ashley said that Neil has made [his (PRP$)| the younger Bush (NNP)] own decisions in the matter 
What we do is talk about the consequences of one course or another , Ashley said 
Ashley said that his own experience in politics and in bank regulation make him a good source for advice for Neil Bush 
The situation is such that he ca not go to his father and talk to him , Ashley said 
[It (PRP)| a partisan matter (NN)] is not a partisan matter or he would not be coming to a Democrat , Ashley added 
[It (PRP)| a partisan matter (NN)] is just a situation where somebody he is known for a long time is available and has experience in matters involving regulatory matters 
[I (PRP)| Ashley , a banking lobbyist (NNP)] am a good sounding board , Ashley added 
Ashley said that Neil Bush decided on [his (PRP$)| the younger Bush (NNP)] own not to take the easy way out and that [he (PRP)| the younger Bush (NNP)] is been the victim of a little selective treatment from federal regulators 
But , Ashley said , [He (PRP)| the younger Bush (NNP)] has not whined or complained about that 
He said that Neil Bush was concerned that when the Office of Thrift Supervision decided to go public about the case , [it (PRP)| the Office of Thrift Supervision (NNP)] only presented [its (PRP$)| the Office of Thrift Supervision (NNP)] side of the matter 
A thousand pages 
It did not include Neil's defense 
Ashley and Bush have remained close friends since [they (PRP)| Ashley , a banking lobbyist (NNP)] were both members of the secret society Skull and Bones while [they (PRP)| Ashley , a banking lobbyist (NNP)] were undergraduates at Yale University in the late 1940s
