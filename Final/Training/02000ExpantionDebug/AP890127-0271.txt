President Bush today said [he (PRP)| President Bush (NNP)] could suppport an increased minimum wage but only if Congress also established a sub-minimum training wage [he (PRP)| President Bush (NNP)] said would prevent a loss of jobs 
[I (PRP)| President Bush (NNP)] have always said that my position on minimum wage is that [I (PRP)| President Bush (NNP)] would want [it (PRP)| my position on minimum wage (NN)] linked to a training wage , to a differential of sorts , so that you do not throw people out of work by raising the minimum wage , Bush said at a White House news conference 
Bush said [he (PRP)| President Bush (NNP)] had a certain flexibility on the question and would await the recommendations of Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole 
At no point did [he (PRP)| President Bush (NNP)] say outright that [he (PRP)| President Bush (NNP)] supported raising the minumum wage , which has been $ 3.35 an hour since 1981 
The president's comments came a day after Mrs. Dole told the Senate Labor Committee that Bush's support of legislation to raise the minimum wage would hinge on whether lawmakers included a training wage in the legislation 
Bush's stand puts [him (PRP)| President Bush (NNP)] in opposition to the head of the Labor Committee , Edward M. Kennedy , who said Thursday [he (PRP)| President Bush (NNP)] remained opposed to a training wage and was confident [his (PRP$)| President Bush (NNP)] bill to raise the minimum hourly wage from $ 3.35 an hour to $ 4.55 would pass this year 
Bush during the presidential campaign said in one interview that [he (PRP)| President Bush (NNP)] supported some increase in the minimum wage , provided it was coupled with the training wage , although at other times [his (PRP$)| President Bush (NNP)] campaign said Bush was against an increase 
Mrs. Dole , sworn in to [her (PRP$)| Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole (NNP)] Cabinet post four hours before the hearing , was not specific as to how high Bush favors raising the minimum wage or what kind of time limit to set on the training wage 
Employers would be limited as to the length of time [they (PRP)| Employers (NNS)] could pay the training wage to a new worker 
We have really not at this point had an opportunity to work through the legislative agenda so [I (PRP)| Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole (NNP)] do want an opportunity to go through this before [I (PRP)| Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole (NNP)] get into any great detail of what [he (PRP)| a new worker (NN)] is willing to support , Mrs. Dole said 
We are going to get [it (PRP)| no point (NN)] raised this year for sure , Kennedy , D-Mass. , said at the hearing , which [he (PRP)| Edward M. Kennedy (NNP)] called to assess the impact of projected labor shortages and the prospect of averting them by training welfare recipients and lower-income workers for high-skills jobs 
Mrs. Dole said [she (PRP)| Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole (NNP)] could help erase the so-called skills gap in the American labor force by working to better coordinate the numerous job-training programs of government agencies and placing an emphasis on training the poor and unemployed 
Minorities , the disadvantaged , persons with disabilities and other groups traditionally left behind will be in demand by employers as never before , but only if [they (PRP)| Employers (NNS)] are qualified , Mrs. Dole said 
In a brief interview after the hearing , Kennedy , who introduced his minimum wage bill Wednesday , said [my (PRP$)| Edward M. Kennedy (NNP)] views have not changed and that [he (PRP)| Edward M. Kennedy (NNP)] would try to get the bill through the Senate without a provision for a training wage 
Organized labor supports the increased minimum wage but opposes the training wage , in part because [it (PRP)| Organized labor (NN)] believes some employers would use the lower wage to cut [their (PRP$)| some employers (NNS)] costs by hiring people at the training wage and laying off higher-paid workers 
Mrs. Dole said [she (PRP)| Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole (NNP)] would support adding language to the legislation to prevent that 
Kennedy's bill would raise the minimum wage from $ 3.35 an hour , [its (PRP$)| Kennedy's bill (NN)] level since 1981 , to $ 4.55 in three annual increases of 40 cents an hour 
The wage then would be indexed to 50 percent of the hourly average income for U.S. workers 
A similar bill has been introduced in the House
