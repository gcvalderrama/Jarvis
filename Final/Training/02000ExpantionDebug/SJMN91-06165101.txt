The cool-headed guerrilla seismologist from Menlo Park whose accurate predictions of the eruptions of Mount Pinatubo helped save thousands of lives in the Philippines is right where [he (PRP)| The cool-headed guerrilla seismologist from Menlo Park whose accurate predictions of the eruptions of Mount Pinatubo helped save thousands of lives in the Philippines (NN)] wants to be a cramped bunker a dozen miles from the exploding volcano. ; One of only a handful of volcano seismologists in the world , David Harlow , 47 , is known as an Indiana Jones of volcanoes , jumping at the chance to get close enough to pick up the bumps and tremors that signal an impending eruption and thriving on the high-pressure decision-making that goes with making predictions 
[He (PRP)| The cool-headed guerrilla seismologist from Menlo Park whose accurate predictions of the eruptions of Mount Pinatubo helped save thousands of lives in the Philippines (NN)] is someone who eats [it (PRP)| Menlo Park whose accurate predictions of the eruptions of Mount Pinatubo helped save thousands of lives in the Philippines (NNP)] up , said Randy White , Harlow's friend and colleague at the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park 
[He (PRP)| The cool-headed guerrilla seismologist from Menlo Park whose accurate predictions of the eruptions of Mount Pinatubo helped save thousands of lives in the Philippines (NN)] is able to totally concentrate in those sorts of situations 
; The eruptions at Mount Pinatubo finally gave Harlow the chance to put [his (PRP$)| Mount Pinatubo (NNP)] skills and experience to work saving lives 
When Harlow went to Mount St. Helens in Washington state in 1980 , geologists were still learning how to read the telltale earthquakes 
Bureaucratic delays kept Harlow from arriving at Nevado de Ruiz in Colombia until a day after [its (PRP$)| Nevado de Ruiz in Colombia (NNP)] 1985 eruption 
Harlow and [his (PRP$)| David Harlow (NNP)] team predicted the 1989 eruption of Redoubt Volcano in Alaska , but few lives were threatened in the remote area. ; Three weeks ago , Harlow joined a team of five U.S. Geological Survey scientists who worked with 10 Filipino scientists to try to forecast the eruption of the volcano , which had been dormant for about 600 years 
One crew gathered evidence of Pinatubo's earlier eruptions as clues to its potential power. ; Harlow's team set up a ring of a half-dozen seismographs around the volcano to measure the deep tremors caused by molten lava slowly pushing to the surface and the shallower tremors that follow when the eruption is imminent. ; Pinatubo followed an almost textbook pattern over the past six weeks 
Gradually building earthquakes were followed by the release of gas , the buildup of magma and finally the huge explosions that sent ash clouds more than 75,000 feet into the sky and sent avalanches of hot ash pouring down the narrow valleys west of the volcano. ; Philippine and U.S. Air Force officials ordered evacuations Monday. ; Since late Tuesday , Harlow's colleagues have not been able to get through on the single phone line into the bunker at Clark Air Base , but do not believe the team is in danger 
The eruption is on the west side of the mountain , with the summit shielding Clark 
Prevailing winds are also away from the base. ; [I (PRP)| Pauline Lord , Harlow's wife (NNP)] am not so concerned , said Pauline Lord , Harlow's wife 
[My (PRP$)| Pauline Lord , Harlow's wife (NNP)] husband is not unaccustomed to danger 
; Lord said Harlow's love affair with volcanoes began when [he (PRP)| Lord (NNP)] was an undergraduate student at Dartmouth College and [his (PRP$)| David Harlow (NNP)] professor took the entire class to observe an eruption in Guatemala. ; [He (PRP)| David Harlow (NNP)] is somebody who is fascinated by that kind of energy , said Lord , a psychotherapist who has accompanied Harlow to several volcanoes 
[It (PRP)| Harlow's love affair with volcanoes (NN)] is wonderful to see that lava sloshing around 
; Harlow's 5-year-old daughter , Megan , is not worried about [her (PRP$)| Megan (NNP)] father. ; [She (PRP)| Megan (NNP)] knows Daddy is in the Philippines and that [he (PRP)| Daddy (NNP)] is fixing a volcano , Lord said
