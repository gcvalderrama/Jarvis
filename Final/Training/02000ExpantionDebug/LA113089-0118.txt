Lincoln Savings & Loan owner Charles H. Keating Jr. was a con man who relied on lies and political influence juice to fool and bully regulators in charge of his ill-fated Irvine-based thrift , California Savings and Loan Commissioner William J. Crawford told an Assembly committee Wednesday 
The committee also heard Gov. George Deukmejian's top campaign fund-raiser , Los Angeles attorney Karl M. Samuelian , defend [his (PRP$)| Gov. George Deukmejian's (NNP)] actions as one of Keating's attorneys , hired to represent the Arizona businessman's interests before state regulators 
Samuelian said [he (PRP)| Karl M. Samuelian (NNP)] recommended the appointment of two successive state corporations commissioners both of whom subsequently approved the sales of high-risk junk bonds by Lincoln's parent corporation 
Samuelian , Deukmejian's campaign finance chairman since 1982 , also said that [he (PRP)| Karl M. Samuelian (NNP)] represented Keating at several meetings with state regulators 
After the hearing , Samuelian told reporters that [he (PRP)| Karl M. Samuelian (NNP)] helped set up meetings between Keating and the regulatorsboss , Business , Transportation and Housing Secretary John K. Geoghegan 
But [it (PRP)| the hearing (NN)] was Crawford's blunt remarks about Keating's tactics and demeanor that provided the most provocative testimony Wednesday before the Assembly's Finance and Insurance Committee 
Asked for a simple explanation of why Lincoln Savings failed , prompting a federal takeover in April that could cost taxpayers more than $ 2 billion , Crawford said : If [I (PRP)| Loan Commissioner William J. Crawford (NNP)] had to pick one reason , [I (PRP)| Loan Commissioner William J. Crawford (NNP)] would have to say that probably the owner was a con man 
[He (PRP)| a con man who relied on lies and political influence juice (NN)] was a dominant person who believed that [he (PRP)| a con man who relied on lies and political influence juice (NN)] was above the law and regulations , that [he (PRP)| a con man who relied on lies and political influence juice (NN)] was powerful and [he (PRP)| a con man who relied on lies and political influence juice (NN)] had the juice and [he (PRP)| a con man who relied on lies and political influence juice (NN)] could win 
[He (PRP)| a con man who relied on lies and political influence juice (NN)] could fight the regulators , and [he (PRP)| a con man who relied on lies and political influence juice (NN)] did a very good job of [it (PRP)| the law (NN)] 
When Keating first took over Lincoln in February , 1984 , [he (PRP)| Keating (NNP)] told state regulators one thing but all along planned to do another , Crawford said 
[They (PRP)| state regulators (NNS)] said [they (PRP)| state regulators (NNS)] were going to run a traditional savings and loan 
[They (PRP)| state regulators (NNS)] lied to us , Crawford said 
Instead , Crawford said , Keating used Lincoln's citizen deposits and sales of high-risk bonds as sources of cash for marginal land acquisitions in Arizona , Colorado , Texas and Louisiana 
Crawford said that when [he (PRP)| Loan Commissioner William J. Crawford (NNP)] took over the department in 1985 , [he (PRP)| Loan Commissioner William J. Crawford (NNP)] found that [his (PRP$)| Loan Commissioner William J. Crawford (NNP)] predecessor had allowed Keating to keep the original records of Lincoln Savings in Phoenix , leaving only incomplete copies of documents for California regulators in the Lincoln offices in Irvine 
Crawford said [he (PRP)| Loan Commissioner William J. Crawford (NNP)] ordered Lincoln's files to be brought back to California after [he (PRP)| Loan Commissioner William J. Crawford (NNP)] discovered Keating had contributed $ 50,000 to Arizona's attorney general in an uncontested race a move that persuaded [him (PRP)| Keating (NNP)] that any action by California regulators would be resisted by [their (PRP$)| bully regulators in charge of his ill-fated Irvine-based thrift , California Savings and Loan Commissioner William J. Crawford (NNS)] counterparts in Arizona 
[He (PRP)| Loan Commissioner William J. Crawford (NNP)] also said regulators needed the centralized files to help keep up with Keating's financial empire , which expanded from 32 corporations in 1984 to 54 entities by the end of 1987 
That was 54 places to hide the smoking gun , said Crawford , who added : [We (PRP)| bully regulators in charge of his ill-fated Irvine-based thrift , California Savings and Loan Commissioner William J. Crawford (NNS)] were never on top of the problems of Lincoln Savings ... 
[They (PRP)| 32 corporations in 1984 (NNS)] could write up (the value of )[their (PRP$)| 32 corporations in 1984 (NNS)] assets faster than you could write [them (PRP)| 32 corporations in 1984 (NNS)] down 
He said the task was made even more difficult by the phalanx of Keating employees and attorneys , who overwhelmed understaffed regulators 
Crawford said [he (PRP)| Loan Commissioner William J. Crawford (NNP)] tried to keep tabs of Lincoln with only one experienced examiner and two trainees 
[They (PRP)| only one experienced examiner and two trainees (NN)] (Lincoln and American Continental )had a battery of people 
[They (PRP)| only one experienced examiner and two trainees (NN)] had 48 CPAs , [they (PRP)| only one experienced examiner and two trainees (NN)] had 15 attorneys on staff 
[I (PRP)| Loan Commissioner William J. Crawford (NNP)] just lately learned [they (PRP)| only one experienced examiner and two trainees (NN)] employed 77 outside law firms , Crawford said 
Referring to a Home Loan Bank Board memo that said Keating had attempted to have [him (PRP)| Keating (NNP)] fired , Crawford said [he (PRP)| Keating (NNP)] did not know of any such effort but added that [he (PRP)| Keating (NNP)] , like federal regulators , felt beat up by the Arizona businessman 
Proof of the Pudding But [he (PRP)| Keating (NNP)] insisted that no one from Deukmejian's office tried to influence [his (PRP$)| Gov. George Deukmejian's (NNP)] handling of Lincoln 
He had the juice (but )he did not have it on a direct line from the governor to me 
[I (PRP)| Loan Commissioner William J. Crawford (NNP)] am still here , and that is proof of the pudding , [I (PRP)| Loan Commissioner William J. Crawford (NNP)] think , Crawford said 
The committee's chairman , Assemblyman Patrick Johnston (D-Stockton ), expressed concern about allegations that Keating and [his (PRP$)| Keating (NNP)] associates used political connections to influence state regulators 
Keating was invited to attend the committee hearing but did not respond , Johnston said 
Deukmejian fund-raiser Samuelian , however , said [he (PRP)| Karl M. Samuelian (NNP)] has never contacted the governor on behalf of any client 
As far as the governor is concerned , [I (PRP)| Karl M. Samuelian (NNP)] have religiously for 10 years separated [my (PRP$)| Karl M. Samuelian (NNP)] business matters from [my (PRP$)| Karl M. Samuelian (NNP)] (campaign )assistance to the governor , [he (PRP)| Karl M. Samuelian (NNP)] said 
Samuelian outlined 1986 and 1987 contributions to Deukmejian's campaign committee from Keating's companies , relatives and business associates totaling $ 150,000 , plus an additional $ 100,000 to Republican fund-raising efforts in California that Samuelian collected 
However , [he (PRP)| Karl M. Samuelian (NNP)] denied ever lobbying for Keating or his companies 
[We (PRP)| Keating or his companies (NNP)] were representing a client as a lawyer , not doing any lobbying work , Samuelian said 
After the hearing , Samuelian said [he (PRP)| Karl M. Samuelian (NNP)] helped set up Keating's meetings in February and March , 1988 , with Transportation and Housing Secretary Geoghegan , a Deukmejian appointee whose agency oversees the state's savings and loan and corporations regulators 
Samuelian also revealed to the committee Wednesday that [he (PRP)| Karl M. Samuelian (NNP)] had recommended that Deukmejian appoint two former law associates , Franklin Tom and Christine W. Bender , as corporation commissioners 
The governor named Tom first , and then Bender succeeded [him (PRP)| Christine W. Bender (NNP)] 
Both Tom and Bender approved the sale of controversial high-risk bonds issued by American Continental and sold through Lincoln's branches 
After Tom left [his (PRP$)| Franklin Tom (NNP)] post as commissioner , [he (PRP)| Franklin Tom (NNP)] rejoined Samuelian's law firm and represented Keating's position in meetings with Bender , [his (PRP$)| Franklin Tom (NNP)] successor and former deputy 
Wording Deleted Also during the hearing , state savings and loan examiner Richard Newsom said the state attorney general's office deleted wording in a December , 1988 , cease-and-desist order against American Continental that could have warned investors not to buy the company's high-risk junk bonds 
Newsom said the wording would have been the atomic bomb to end the junk bond sales , which continued through early 1989 
But , [he (PRP)| loan examiner Richard Newsom (NNP)] added , the attorney general balked at including the language because [his (PRP$)| loan examiner Richard Newsom (NNP)] office lacked the expertise to defend the state on a court challenge over securities matters 
However , Newsom's testimony was immediately refuted by both Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp and an attorney for the Savings and Loan Department 
The attorney , Shirley Thayer , said [she (PRP)| Shirley Thayer (NNP)] and others in the department made the decision to drop the language , not Van de Kamp 
In Washington , meanwhile , White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said President Bush had no immediate plans to oust M. Danny Wall , the embattled chairman of the office of thrift supervision 
Wall , who previously headed the Federal Home Loan Bank Board , is under fire for not acting on a recommendation by regional regulators to seize Lincoln in 1987 
The government did not take control of the thrift until last April , and critics contend that the delay greatly increased the eventual cost to taxpayers 
Asked at a press briefing if the White House planned to fire Wall , Fitzwater replied : No , there is been no consideration of Mr. Wall's tenure 
[He (PRP)| M. Danny Wall (NNP)] is serving on the (office of thrift supervision )board , and there is been no change 
Calls for Wall's resignation have increased in recent days 
On Wednesday , three nonprofit organizations the National Taxpayers Union , Public Citizen and Citizens Against Government sent a letter to Bush urging [him (PRP)| President Bush (NNP)] to oust Wall
