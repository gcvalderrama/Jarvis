In choosing federal Judge Robert Bork for the Supreme Court , President Reagan has tapped a leading architect of conservative legal theory and has ensured a tough confirmation battle in the Senate 
The selection of the 60-year-old Judge Bork to replace retiring Justice Lewis Powell gives the president [his (PRP$)| the 60-year-old Judge Bork (NNP)] third Supreme Court appointment and by far [his (PRP$)| the 60-year-old Judge Bork (NNP)] greatest opportunity to alter the court's direction 
The high court , with Justice Powell often the swing vote , has been narrowly divided for a number of years on volatile social issues , including upholding abortion and affirmative action 
But in Judge Bork , appointed by Mr. Reagan in 1982 to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia , the president has picked a rare judicial rather than a political conservative , a judge committed to a narrow role for the courts rather than to the Reagan administration's political agenda 
A scholar and formidable writer , the former Yale Law School professor has made [his (PRP$)| A scholar (NN)] mark in antitrust law and a wide range of constitutional issues , urging judges to base [their (PRP$)| judges (NNS)] rulings on the intent of the framers of the Constitution 
However , judicial conservatives most often tend to reach conclusions that support conservative political views 
And liberal Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee , fearful that Mr. Reagan's choice may upset the Supreme Court's moderate balance , have made clear [they (PRP)| judicial conservatives (NNS)] will fight any candidate whose views about the Constitution and the courts are too conservative 
Yesterday , Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts , a Judiciary Committee member , lost no time urging that Judge Bork should be defeated 
[He (PRP)| Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts , a Judiciary Committee member (NNP)] stands for an extremist view of the Constitution and the role of the Supreme Court , Sen. Kennedy said 
No justice would be better than this injustice 
President Reagan announced [his (PRP$)| President Reagan (NNP)] choice yesterday afternoon in the White House press room , lavishing praise on the nominee's intellectual abilities 
Judge Bork , widely regarded as the most prominent and intellectually powerful advocate of judicial restraint , shares [my (PRP$)| Judge Bork (NNP)] views that judgespersonal preferences and values should not be part of [their (PRP$)| judges (NNS)] constitutional interpretations , Mr. Reagan said 
[He (PRP)| the 60-year-old Judge Bork (NNP)] described Judge Bork , who stood next to [him (PRP)| the 60-year-old Judge Bork (NNP)] without comment , as an impressive legal mind and a premier constitutional authority 
The announcement came just five days after Justice Powell announced [his (PRP$)| retiring Justice Lewis Powell (NNP)] retirement , citing [his (PRP$)| retiring Justice Lewis Powell (NNP)] health and the approach of [his (PRP$)| retiring Justice Lewis Powell (NNP)] 80th birthday 
From the outset , Judge Bork was the clear front-runner to fill the vacancy , being favored by Attorney General Edwin Meese and his aides 
The only questions were whether to go with a younger conservative whose influence would last well into the next century and whether the strength of Judge Bork's conservative views would make [his (PRP$)| Judge Bork (NNP)] confirmation too difficult 
While the White House put aside the age issue , the confirmation process is likely to be a contentious one , both in the 14-member Senate Judiciary Committee and on the Senate floor 
But the expectation , even among some Democrats , is that Judge Bork will be approved 
The initial skirmish is over when confirmation hearings will begin 
Committee Democrats say they do not expect to start hearings until September , raising questions about whether Judge Bork would be approved by the Supreme Court's opening next Oct. 5 
President Reagan urged the Senate to expedite [its (PRP$)| the Senate (NNP)] consideration ; [his (PRP$)| President Reagan (NNP)] aides will push for a July start , although [they (PRP)| his aides (NNS)] are not sure [they (PRP)| his aides (NNS)] will succeed 
The nomination presents a political problem for some Democrats 
Judge Bork is a difficult target , since [his (PRP$)| Judge Bork (NNP)] intellectual prowess is widely respected in legal circles , even by those who disagree with [him (PRP)| Judge Bork (NNP)] 
Judiciary Chairman Joseph Biden , a Delaware Democrat , and Democratic Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois , both presidential candidates , must satisfy liberal civil-rights groups that are already gearing up to battle the nomination and at the same time must avoid embarrassing [themselves (PRP)| Judiciary Chairman Joseph Biden , a Delaware Democrat , and Democratic Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois , both presidential candidates (NNP)] by using specious arguments , especially if the fight against Judge Bork proves futile 
The president's nominee to become the 104th justice is a bear of a man 
At 6 feet , over 200 pounds and rotund , with hair like a scouring pad and a beard to match , [he (PRP)| The president's nominee to become the 104th justice (NN)] is an imposing figure , made more so by [his (PRP$)| The president's nominee to become the 104th justice (NN)] deep baritone voice 
An affable man , [he (PRP)| An affable man (NN)] occasionally grows impatient with lesser intellects and inefficiency 
[His (PRP$)| An affable man (NN)] wife , Mary Ellen , a former nun , has been a calming influence , friends say , although also a very conservative one 
[It (PRP)| a calming influence (NN)] is [his (PRP$)| An affable man (NN)] second marriage 
[His (PRP$)| An affable man (NN)] first wife , Clare , died of cancer in 1980 , and [he (PRP)| An affable man (NN)] remarried in October 1982 
Judge Bork was at one time a cross-country skier and tennis player , and [he (PRP)| Judge Bork (NNP)] recently resumed playing tennis out of apparent concern about [his (PRP$)| Judge Bork (NNP)] weight and general health 
But friends say [his (PRP$)| Judge Bork (NNP)] pursuits tend more to the intellectual 
[He (PRP)| Judge Bork (NNP)] sometimes listens to books on tape while driving to work from [his (PRP$)| Judge Bork (NNP)] northwest Washington home , and while solicitor general in the Nixon administration , [he (PRP)| President Nixon (NNP)] pored over the New York Times crossword puzzle daily 
[He (PRP)| Judge Bork (NNP)] does enjoy a good party and has on occasion been the one to close the bar 
At a solicitor general's office reunion in 1978 , the dinner went some $ 250 over budget because Judge Bork kept the bar open well after the planned closing 
[He (PRP)| General (NNP)] first caught the eye of the legal community writing about antitrust law as a Yale Law School professor in the 1960s 
In 1971 , [he (PRP)| General (NNP)] earned his reputation as an intellectual , conservative legal scholar with an article taking a narrow view of the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of speech 
In 1973 , President Nixon tapped [him (PRP)| the Justice Department official who represents the executive branch before the Supreme Court (NN)] to be solicitor general , the Justice Department official who represents the executive branch before the Supreme Court 
It was as solicitor general that in October 1973 [he (PRP)| the Justice Department official who represents the executive branch before the Supreme Court (NN)] fired Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox , after Attorney General Elliot Richardson and Mr. Richardson's deputy , William Ruckelshaus , resigned rather than carry out President Nixon's order 
Judge Bork returned to Yale from 1977 to 1981 when [he (PRP)| Judge Bork (NNP)] practiced law for a year before [he (PRP)| Judge Bork (NNP)] was nominated for the federal appeals court in Washington , D.C. 
Mr. Richardson , now a Washington lawyer , defends Mr. Bork's actions 
Mr. Richardson says Mr. Bork considered resigning but that [he (PRP)| Judge Bork (NNP)] urged [him (PRP)| Judge Bork (NNP)] to remain for the stability of the Justice Department 
Nevertheless , Sen. Kennedy yesterday suggested that the Saturday Night Massacre will be an issue , saying the president should not be able to reach out of the muck of Irangate -LCB- and -RCB- reach into the muck of Watergate for a Supreme Court nominee 
But [it (PRP)| Yesterday (NN)] is Judge Bork's prolific and forceful writings as a law professor and judge that have earned [him (PRP)| Judge Bork (NNP)] [his (PRP$)| Judge Bork (NNP)] reputation as an intellectual leader of conservative legal thought for a generation of law school graduates 
And it is those views that will be scrutinized closely by the Senate 
Unless Judge Bork can demonstrate to [me (PRP)| conference yesterday in Houston (NN)] that [he (PRP)| Judge Bork (NNP)] comes to the court with an open mind , [I (PRP)| conference yesterday in Houston (NN)] would have some difficulty , said Sen. Biden at a press conference yesterday in Houston 
Many civil rights and women's groups reacted quickly against the nomination 
There is tremendous potential for rolling back the gains [we (PRP)| women's groups (NNS)] have made in civil rights and civil liberties over the past 30 years , said Judith Lichtman , executive director of the Women's Legal Defense Fund 
And the AFL-CIO urged senators to refrain from endorsing Judge Bork until [they (PRP)| senators (NNS)] can carefully review [his (PRP$)| Judge Bork (NNP)] record 
Once a New Deal liberal , Judge Bork became more conservative while at the University of Chicago 
There [he (PRP)| Judge Bork (NNP)] studied economics under Aaron Director , a pioneer in applying economic logic to challenge a variety of theories and liberal beliefs 
In 1963 , [he (PRP)| Judge Bork (NNP)] wrote an article in the New Republic magazine challenging part of the proposed 1964 Civil Rights Act that would require desegregation of private facilities serving the public , such as lunch counters and hotels 
The law would impose the majority's morality on the minority , [he (PRP)| Judge Bork (NNP)] said 
But in 1973 , [he (PRP)| Judge Bork (NNP)] told the Senate Judiciary Committee [he (PRP)| Judge Bork (NNP)] had abandoned [his (PRP$)| Judge Bork (NNP)] view and fully supported the civil-rights law 
In 1968 , in a Fortune magazine article , [he (PRP)| Judge Bork (NNP)] was strongly critical of the Supreme Court under Chief Justice Earl Warren , saying it is in the process of descending in national estimation from a position above the battle to the status of a political institution 
The justices , [he (PRP)| Judge Bork (NNP)] said , decide cases not according to the criteria [they (PRP)| The justices (NNS)] cite but according to [their (PRP$)| The justices (NNS)] social and political sympathies 
In that article , [he (PRP)| Judge Bork (NNP)] described a landmark 1965 opinion recognizing a right to privacy that entitled married couples to use contraceptives in [their (PRP$)| married couples (NNS)] home as shallow , murky and rhetorical and one more slogan that some justices will use ... in the process of writing [their (PRP$)| married couples (NNS)] own tastes into the law 
[It (PRP)| a Fortune magazine article (NN)] was that 1965 ruling that was the basis for the Supreme Court's 1973 decision recognizing a woman's right to an abortion , and Judge Bork's criticism of sexual privacy has caused alarm among women's groups over [his (PRP$)| Judge Bork (NNP)] nomination 
Indeed , in a 1984 appeals-court ruling , [he (PRP)| Judge Bork (NNP)] declined to extend the right of sexual privacy to homosexual conduct and criticized the Supreme Court's record on privacy 
If the revolution in sexual mores ... is in fact ever to arrive , [he (PRP)| Judge Bork (NNP)] wrote , [we (PRP)| women's groups (NNS)] think [it (PRP)| the revolution in sexual mores (NN)] must arrive through the moral choices of the people and [their (PRP$)| the people (NNS)] elected representatives , not through the judicial ukase of this court 
But some friends and colleagues say [his (PRP$)| Judge Bork (NNP)] views do not mean that [he (PRP)| Judge Bork (NNP)] would automatically vote to overrule the right to abortion 
[He (PRP)| Judge Bork (NNP)] is a true judicial conservative , says Dennis Hutchinson , a University of Chicago law professor , and that means judges are supposed to defer to the decisions of the legislature 
Another hallmark of judicial conservatives is putting great weight on the importance of honoring precedents 
In a 1985 interview with District Lawyer magazine , [he (PRP)| Judge Bork (NNP)] explained that [he (PRP)| Judge Bork (NNP)] is more likely to stick to precedents in constitutional cases if so much legislation and so many other decisions have relied on [them (PRP)| judicial conservatives (NNS)] that [they (PRP)| judicial conservatives (NNS)] have become part of the structure of the nation 
But [he (PRP)| Judge Bork (NNP)] has not said how [he (PRP)| Judge Bork (NNP)] would handle challenges to controversial precedents on which the Supreme Court is divided : abortion , affirmative action , school prayer and school busing , among others 
Judge Bork has been widely and sharply critical of the Supreme Court's 1964 decision establishing the principle of one person , one vote 
[His (PRP$)| Judge Bork (NNP)] criticism is based largely on the view that it is purely a political issue that is best left to the legislatures to decide for [themselves (PRP)| others (NNS)] 
Views [he (PRP)| Judge Bork (NNP)] expressed in 1971 in a series of lectures at Indiana University Law School argued that the First Amendment protects only speech expressly about government and politics 
But [he (PRP)| Judge Bork (NNP)] has since modified [his (PRP$)| Judge Bork (NNP)] position , concluding that many other forms of discourse , such as moral and scientific debate , are central to democratic government and deserve protection 
[He (PRP)| Judge Bork (NNP)] excluded obscene and pornographic material from the First Amendment altogether 
As a judge , [he (PRP)| a good friend of President Reagan's last nominee , Justice Antonin Scalia (NN)] has devoted much of [his (PRP$)| a good friend of President Reagan's last nominee , Justice Antonin Scalia (NN)] energy to questions of what are proper issues for courts to decide , taking a tough view on when a plaintiff has suffered sufficient injury to bring a lawsuit 
In a 1985 opinion , [he (PRP)| a good friend of President Reagan's last nominee , Justice Antonin Scalia (NN)] argued against including sexual harassment as a form of job discrimination that is barred by the 1964 Civil Rights Act 
But in two 1984 cases , [he (PRP)| a good friend of President Reagan's last nominee , Justice Antonin Scalia (NN)] cast votes giving a moderate reading to the free-speech and free-press clauses of the First Amendment 
In the antitrust field , [he (PRP)| a good friend of President Reagan's last nominee , Justice Antonin Scalia (NN)] has argued long and effectively that the laws were only intended to regulate consumer welfare and were not intended to protect smaller or less efficient companies from competition 
As a result , [he (PRP)| a good friend of President Reagan's last nominee , Justice Antonin Scalia (NN)] has often opposed government efforts to block mergers that created conglomerates 
Those who know [him (PRP)| a good friend of President Reagan's last nominee , Justice Antonin Scalia (NN)] expect [he (PRP)| a good friend of President Reagan's last nominee , Justice Antonin Scalia (NN)] would be a powerful force at the Supreme Court , although [he (PRP)| a good friend of President Reagan's last nominee , Justice Antonin Scalia (NN)] was sometimes slow and even bored with [his (PRP$)| a good friend of President Reagan's last nominee , Justice Antonin Scalia (NN)] work at the appeals court 
[He (PRP)| a good friend of President Reagan's last nominee , Justice Antonin Scalia (NN)] is not the kind of judge who invests a lot of time trying to lobby others to join [him (PRP)| a good friend of President Reagan's last nominee , Justice Antonin Scalia (NN)] , but [he (PRP)| a good friend of President Reagan's last nominee , Justice Antonin Scalia (NN)] hopes to persuade [them (PRP)| others (NNS)] with the force of [his (PRP$)| a good friend of President Reagan's last nominee , Justice Antonin Scalia (NN)] opinions , associates say 
If [he (PRP)| a good friend of President Reagan's last nominee , Justice Antonin Scalia (NN)] gets to the Supreme Court , associates expect [him (PRP)| a good friend of President Reagan's last nominee , Justice Antonin Scalia (NN)] to help form a strong conservative coalition 
[He (PRP)| a good friend of President Reagan's last nominee , Justice Antonin Scalia (NN)] is a good friend of President Reagan's last nominee , Justice Antonin Scalia , and Chief Justice William Rehnquist used to stay with Judge Bork on visits to Yale
