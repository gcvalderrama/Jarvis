As Rodney G. King was beaten by Los Angeles Police officers on March 3 , other officers seized one of King's passengers , Bryant Allen , who says [he (PRP)| Rodney G. King (NNP)] was manhandled and taunted in a racially motivated attempt to provoke him. ; In an interview , Allen said [he (PRP)| Bryant Allen (NNP)] feared for [his (PRP$)| Bryant Allen (NNP)] life as [he (PRP)| Bryant Allen (NNP)] was made to crawl along the ground , hearing at the same time [his (PRP$)| Bryant Allen (NNP)] friend's screams and the sounds of police batons from the far side of the car 
[He (PRP)| Rodney G. King (NNP)] was screaming , Stop ! 
said Allen , who said [he (PRP)| Bryant Allen (NNP)] heard but did not see his friend being beaten 
Then [he (PRP)| his friend being beaten (NN)] kind of quit , and all you could hear was like bones being broken , a crunching , like a whip sound 
; In the first complete account of the incident from one who was there , Allen , 25 , said [he (PRP)| Bryant Allen (NNP)] believed the beating of King and the blows directed at [him (PRP)| Bryant Allen (NNP)] and a second passenger , Freddie Helms , were racially motivated. ; All three men in the car were black 
The police officers were white 
As many as 21 Los Angeles police officers were present ; a sergeant and three officers have been indicted on assault charges. ; Allen's lawyer , John C. Burton , said [he (PRP)| John C. Burton (NNP)] would file a federal civil rights suit 
King's lawyer said Tuesday [he (PRP)| King's lawyer (NN)] also would file a suit 
None of the three men in the car has been charged. ; Allen tapped [his (PRP$)| Bryant Allen (NNP)] foot slowly as [he (PRP)| Bryant Allen (NNP)] sat with [his (PRP$)| Bryant Allen (NNP)] lawyer Tuesday night , watching for the first time the full seven-minute videotape , which includes the two-minute beating that has been shown repeatedly on national television. ; The videotape has led to calls for the resignation of Chief Daryl F. Gates and prompted inquiries into the extent of police brutality nationwide. ; Speaking quietly , Allen described King's erratic behavior behind the wheel on a night when the three men had been drinking beer and said tension was heightened when King had trouble with his seat belt as [he (PRP)| Bryant Allen (NNP)] was complying with police orders to leave [his (PRP$)| Bryant Allen (NNP)] car. ; [He (PRP)| Bryant Allen (NNP)] said that at one point a female officer intervened when [he (PRP)| a female officer (NN)] [himself (PRP)| a female officer (NN)] was threatened with violence 
[She (PRP)| police brutality nationwide. (NN)] is the one who had her hand out saying I did not do anything wrong , Allen recalled 
[She (PRP)| police brutality nationwide. (NN)] was saying , [He (PRP)| Bryant Allen (NNP)] is the one that had his hands up 
; Nevertheless , [he (PRP)| Bryant Allen (NNP)] said , [he (PRP)| Bryant Allen (NNP)] was kicked and manhandled , and Allen said [he (PRP)| Bryant Allen (NNP)] was threatened by officers who said : You want to be like your home boy ? 
You want to be like your home boy ? 
; When the beating was over , the police officers left him and Helms standing by the side of the road , he said 
[They (PRP)| Los Angeles Police officers (NNS)] said , Guess what ? 
I said , What ? 
They said , [You (PRP)| Bryant Allen (NNP)] are in a Crips neighborhood 
They laughed and took off 
; Allen said [he (PRP)| Bryant Allen (NNP)] and his friends , all unemployed , came from a neighborhood claimed by the Bloods , a rival to the Crips gang. ; Since the incident , [he (PRP)| Bryant Allen (NNP)] said , [he (PRP)| Bryant Allen (NNP)] had spoken twice with King , 25 , who suffered multiple fractures and what [his (PRP$)| Bryant Allen (NNP)] lawyer said may be permanent brain damage 
King initially declined to characterize the incident as racial. ; On [his (PRP$)| Rodney G. King (NNP)] recent visits , [he (PRP)| Rodney G. King (NNP)] said , King was having difficulty remembering the night of the beating in a coherent way 
[It (PRP)| the incident from one (NN)] sounded like [he (PRP)| Rodney G. King (NNP)] was talking in riddles , all mixed up , Allen said. ; As Allen recalls [it (PRP)| the incident from one (NN)] , the late-night incident began with the three men speeding down the Foothill Freeway in northern Los Angeles at what might have been as fast as 80 miles an hour 
Burton said the men had each drunk a 40-ounce bottle of Old English 800 malt liquor. ; Burton said , Drugs had absolutely nothing to do with this incident 
Medical tests also showed that King was free of drugs. ; After visiting at Allen's house , King told [his (PRP$)| Bryant Allen (NNP)] friends [he (PRP)| Bryant Allen (NNP)] was taking [them (PRP)| his friends , all unemployed (NNS)] to a park where [he (PRP)| Bryant Allen (NNP)] had gone in the past with [his (PRP$)| Bryant Allen (NNP)] father. ; When [he (PRP)| Medical tests (NNS)] saw the flashing lights of a California Highway Patrol car behind them , Allen said : [I (PRP)| Medical tests (NNS)] told [him (PRP)| Rodney G. King (NNP)] , Rodney , pull over , stop 
[He (PRP)| Rodney G. King (NNP)] just kept on going , kept on driving. ; [I (PRP)| Medical tests (NNS)] thought [he (PRP)| Rodney G. King (NNP)] was pulling over , but [he (PRP)| Rodney G. King (NNP)] was going down the off-ramp 
[We (PRP)| his friends , all unemployed (NNS)] stopped at the stop sign , and then [we (PRP)| his friends , all unemployed (NNS)] were driving again 
[I (PRP)| Medical tests (NNS)] said , Rodney , pull over 
[We (PRP)| his friends , all unemployed (NNS)] were still driving , and the lights were flashing 
[I (PRP)| Medical tests (NNS)] could hear a lot of cars 
Their small white Hyundai was surrounded by police cars and illuminated by the glare of headlights 
[It (PRP)| Their small white Hyundai (NNP)] was at this point , [he (PRP)| Medical tests (NNS)] said , that the other passenger , Helms , who had been asleep in the front seat , woke up. ; The police ordered [us (PRP)| his friends , all unemployed (NNS)] , Driver , put your hands out the window , Allen continued 
[They (PRP)| The police (NN)] said , Take your left hand outside the door and step out 
Rodney had the seat belt , and [it (PRP)| his seat belt (NN)] kind of yanked [him (PRP)| Rodney G. King (NNP)] back 
The police were getting nervous too 
[They (PRP)| The police (NN)] told [him (PRP)| Rodney G. King (NNP)] to lie flat down , and [he (PRP)| Rodney G. King (NNP)] lay flat down 
; Allen said [he (PRP)| Bryant Allen (NNP)] and Helms left the car on the opposite side , beside a large , dark park , and also lay down. ; The police put the handcuffs on [me (PRP)| Bryant Allen (NNP)] , and that is when [I (PRP)| Bryant Allen (NNP)] heard Rodney screaming , Allen went on 
[He (PRP)| Freddie Helms (NNP)] was screaming like [he (PRP)| Freddie Helms (NNP)] was getting a whupping 
; After the screaming stopped , [he (PRP)| Freddie Helms (NNP)] said , [he (PRP)| Freddie Helms (NNP)] continued to hear the whipping sound of the nightsticks through the clatter of a hovering helicopter
