Prosecutors refused to immediately charge a man whose beating by police was played out in painful clarity on the screens of tens of millions of television sets this week from an amateur photographer's videotape. ; Rodney Glen King , 25 , was released from Los Angeles County Jail on Wednesday , sitting in a wheelchair and displaying a broken ankle , damaged eye and bruises 
Police wanted prosecutors to charge King with battery on an officer and resisting arrest , said King's lawyer , Robert Rentzer 
But the district attorney's office refused. ; [We (PRP)| Prosecutors (NNS)] have sent the case back to police for further investigation , said Deputy District Attorney Don Eastman 
There are a lot of things we want to look at and a lot of witnesses who were not interviewed 
; The district attorney's office said officers failed to interview available witnesses , including two of King's passengers 
The 10 officers involved in the beating have been taken off patrol. ; King told reporters that there had been no high-speed car chase as [they (PRP)| reporters (NNS)] insisted , that [he (PRP)| Rodney Glen King (NNP)] had done nothing to provoke the attack and that [he (PRP)| Rodney Glen King (NNP)] was scared for [my (PRP$)| Rodney Glen King (NNP)] life during the beating. ; [I (PRP)| Rodney Glen King (NNP)] am lucky [they (PRP)| The 10 officers involved in the beating (NNS)] did not kill [me (PRP)| Rodney Glen King (NNP)] , [he (PRP)| Rodney Glen King (NNP)] said. ; Witnesses back King's version of what happened early Sunday morning in a Los Angeles suburb , and a CHP officer at the scene said [he (PRP)| Rodney Glen King (NNP)] exhorted the police officers to stop the beating , but was told , in effect , to stay out of [it (PRP)| whose beating (NN)] , according to a source. ; The pursuit of King's white 1988 Hyundai was begun by CHP officers , who estimated that King's car was hitting speeds as high as 115 mph on a freeway 
The CHP officers said that [they (PRP)| The CHP officers (NNS)] called for assistance and had pulled King over in the Terrace San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles. ; At that point , several Los Angeles police officers jumped into the mess , said a law enforcement source familiar with the report CHP officers filed with [their (PRP$)| The CHP officers (NNS)] supervisors 
When the car finally stopped off the freeway , King was ordered out of the car. ; The source said that a police sergeant told the CHP that [his (PRP$)| a police sergeant (NN)] officers would handle things 
Witnesses said that King was already lying on the ground when a police officer shot [him (PRP)| a police officer (NN)] with a stun gun , delivering an electrical shock 
Officers then clubbed [him (PRP)| Rodney Glen King (NNP)] wildly 
There was a brief lull and King lay silent until one officer stomped on [his (PRP$)| one officer (NN)] head. ; King said that police continued to pound on [me (PRP)| Rodney Glen King (NNP)] and beat on [me (PRP)| Rodney Glen King (NNP)] all over [my (PRP$)| Rodney Glen King (NNP)] body ... all over [my (PRP$)| Rodney Glen King (NNP)] body 
[My (PRP$)| Rodney Glen King (NNP)] ankles 
[They (PRP)| officers (NNS)] beat where [it (PRP)| a brief lull (NN)] hurt 
[They (PRP)| officers (NNS)] beat my whole body where [it (PRP)| my whole body (NN)] hurt 
; King , lifting [his (PRP$)| Rodney Glen King (NNP)] hospital garb to show a large bruise on [his (PRP$)| Rodney Glen King (NNP)] chest , said police shocked [me (PRP)| Rodney Glen King (NNP)] ... [they (PRP)| officers (NNS)] paused for a minute and then [they (PRP)| officers (NNS)] struck [me (PRP)| Rodney Glen King (NNP)] across the face real hard with a billy club 
; Witnesses said three or four officers beat King in the two-minute tape , while as many as seven others stood by to watch. ; Please stop ! 
Please stop ! 
King pleaded as [he (PRP)| Rodney Glen King (NNP)] was struck at least 40 times with police batons , said witness Dorothy Gibson. ; King is black 
The races of the police officers involved have not been revealed 
King said [he (PRP)| Rodney Glen King (NNP)] did not hear any racial comments from the officers. ; [They (PRP)| the police officers involved (NNS)] beat [me (PRP)| Rodney Glen King (NNP)] so bad [I (PRP)| Rodney Glen King (NNP)] did not pay attention to what [they (PRP)| the police officers involved (NNS)] were saying , said King , who had been released from jail in December after serving 2Â 1/2 years on a second-degree robbery conviction. ; When [I (PRP)| Rodney Glen King (NNP)] saw [it (PRP)| the officers. (NN)] on TV , [I (PRP)| Rodney Glen King (NNP)] thought , Is this something happening in South Africa or Kuwait ? 
said Keith Huling , 35 , who lives in the same apartment complex as Holliday 
Then [I (PRP)| Keith Huling (NNP)] looked a little closer , and said , Hey , that is the park across the street 
; Witnesses said King did not resist arrest. ; The stunning videotape was recorded by George Holliday , a plumber who was awakened about 12:30 a.m. Sunday by the sound of police helicopters overhead 
Holliday went to the terrace of [his (PRP$)| George Holliday (NNP)] second-story apartment and , seeing police in the street below , decided to get some practice with [his (PRP$)| George Holliday (NNP)] new videotape recorder. ; The world reacted with sickened shock and outrage to the brutal , but some some in the black community here reacted with more of a shrug. ; You talk to people in the black community here , and they say , This is not news , said Joe Hicks , an American Civil Liberties Union spokesman who grew up in the community 
They say , Why are all the white people so surprised ? 
A guy got his butt beat by the cops 
[It (PRP)| his butt beat (NN)] happens all the time 
; Behind the shrug , though , emotions run deep 
There is nothing you can imagine the guy had done that would justify that kind of response , Hicks said. ; Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates , long controversial for racial statements he has made , called the brutality depicted on the tape an aberration 
; The department issued no statements Wednesday 
Agencies including the FBI , the LAPD , Los Angeles District Attorney's Office and the California Highway Patrol are investigating the beating. ; Huling said [he (PRP)| Keith Huling (NNP)] knows of other police beatings that [he (PRP)| Keith Huling (NNP)] believes are racially motivated 
A prevailing sense in [his (PRP$)| the beating. (NN)] neighborhood this week , [he (PRP)| the beating. (NN)] said , is that if [I (PRP)| the beating. (NN)] come home from work and make a turn on a red light , [I (PRP)| the beating. (NN)] am going to get [my (PRP$)| the beating. (NN)] butt kicked 
; The perception that non-Anglos are the targets of police brutality has been chronic here. ; Whether that is a perception or a reality is almost beside the point , because the perception is the reality , said Zev Yaroslavsky , a councilman who has requested public hearings on brutality throughout the city 
[I (PRP)| Zev Yaroslavsky (NNP)] am troubled by the fact that when [I (PRP)| Zev Yaroslavsky (NNP)] learned the person beaten was black , [I (PRP)| Zev Yaroslavsky (NNP)] was not surprised 
[... It is rare that there is an Anglo that gets the crap (PRP)| the fact (NN)] beat out of [him (PRP)| the person beaten (NN)] with a billy club 
; Yaroslavsky pointed to recent incidents of harassment of black people 
Just last December , businessman and former Laker Jamaal Wilkes was handcuffed during a routine traffic stop 
The police department's subsequent apology to [him (PRP)| former Laker Jamaal Wilkes (NNP)] came on the heels of a federal jury award of $ 540,000 to former major league baseball player Joe Morgan , who said Los Angeles police in 1988 had grabbed [him (PRP)| Los Angeles police in 1988 (NN)] by the neck , thrown [him (PRP)| former Laker Jamaal Wilkes (NNP)] to the ground and cuffed [him (PRP)| former Laker Jamaal Wilkes (NNP)] at Los Angeles International Airport when [they (PRP)| businessman and former Laker Jamaal Wilkes (NN)] thought [he (PRP)| former Laker Jamaal Wilkes (NNP)] was a drug courier. ; Last year , 55 residents of one of the city's streets accepted a $ 3 million settlement for damages from a 1988 police drug raid in which officers allegedly wrecked apartments and beat several people. ; [I (PRP)| former Laker Jamaal Wilkes (NNP)] do not think the body politic in Los Angeles has been willing to address [it (PRP)| Los Angeles County Jail (NN)] , Yaroslavsky said 
But what the public has seen in black and white , no pun intended , leaves nothing to the imagination , leaves nothing to interpretation , (and )probably is the one event that may sensitize the politicians
