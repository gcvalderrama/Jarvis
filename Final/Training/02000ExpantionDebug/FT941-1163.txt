As US interest rates rose another notch this week , traders in London and other European financial centres were reminded that the German Bundesbank is not the only star in the monetary firmament 
The US Federal Reserve is still the world's most powerful central bank and [its (PRP$)| The US Federal Reserve (NNP)] decision to start tightening monetary policy while many of America's trading partners are still economically depressed has sent shivers through bond markets from New York to Tokyo 
[It (PRP)| The US Federal Reserve (NNP)] has also irritated the White House , which believes the Fed may be overreacting to what are still only tentative signs of mild upward pressure on inflation 
Last week , President Bill Clinton summoned Mr Alan Greenspan , the Fed chairman , to the White House for talks on economic policy 
In financial markets the ill-timed meeting was seen (perhaps unfairly )as a blatant attempt to put pressure on Mr Greenspan 
The Fed would probably have increased rates anyway this week , but the administration's clumsy intervention settled matters since inaction would have raised doubts about the Fed's independence 
Critics fear that a tighter US monetary policy will slow the pace of economic recovery which , on Main Street , is seen as having only just got going 
US banks are already raising [their (PRP$)| Critics (NNS)] prime lending rates and mortgage rates are up sharply , reflecting the steep increase in bond yields 
The Fed's action need not have much impact on growth overseas , but probably will because European central banks are reluctant to see [their (PRP$)| Critics (NNS)] currencies depreciate against the dollar 
To prevent depreciation , [they (PRP)| Critics (NNS)] may postpone or abandon planned rate cuts 
Although the White House and the Fed disagree on policy , there is little sign of personal animosity 
As policymakers Mr Clinton and Mr Greenspan share a love of detail ; there is every sign that the White House appreciates the quality of Mr Greenspan's economic advice , which many regard as the best available in Washington 
The Fed chief , a Reagan appointee in a city run by Democrats , has also deliberately courted the Clintons 
[He (PRP)| The Fed chief (NN)] sat next to Hillary Rodham Clinton during the presentation of the White House economic plan to Congress last year and subsequently pronounced the deficit-cutting measures credible 
Since the plan included the biggest tax increase on the wealthy in decades , conservatives were infuriated 
[It (PRP)| the White House economic plan (NN)] seemed a strange lapse for a former disciple of Ayn Rand , the ultra-libertarian author 
But [it (PRP)| the White House economic plan (NN)] stood Mr Greenspan , a canny political operator , in good stead 
So far , Mr Clinton has refused to support congressional calls for legislation to reduce the Fed's independence 
And [he (PRP)| President Bill Clinton (NNP)] has offered only lukewarm support for a Treasury plan to strip the Fed of [its (PRP$)| only lukewarm support (NN)] powers as a bank regulator 
Even on interest rates , Mr Clinton is showing more restraint than George Bush , so far expressing only mild misgivings in public about Fed policy 
Mr Greenspan has thus played [his (PRP$)| Mr Alan Greenspan (NNP)] cards shrewdly 
Administration officials doubtless also appreciate the fact that the Fed chief , the most powerful figure in international finance , is so willing to keep out of the public eye 
A fixture on the Washington media and political cocktail circuit ([his (PRP$)| The Fed chief (NN)] girlfriend Ms Andrea Mitchell is a reporter for NBC television ), [he (PRP)| The Fed chief (NN)] often meets privately with journalists 
But [he (PRP)| The Fed chief (NN)] refuses to give on-the-record interviews and unlike other top economic officials [he (PRP)| The Fed chief (NN)] never appears on TV shows 
The public knows [him (PRP)| The Fed chief (NN)] mainly through [his (PRP$)| The Fed chief (NN)] dry , rather technical testimony before congressional committees 
The image [he (PRP)| The Fed chief (NN)] cultivates is of a courteous , knowledgeable and pragmatic civil servant 
Occasionally , however , Mr Greenspan lets slip [his (PRP$)| Mr Alan Greenspan (NNP)] private views and these suggest a more radical temperament 
For example , [he (PRP)| Mr Alan Greenspan (NNP)] advocates the abolition of capital gains tax - not a view shared by many moderate Republicans 
And [he (PRP)| Mr Alan Greenspan (NNP)] recently shocked Democrats by admitting [he (PRP)| Mr Alan Greenspan (NNP)] was a bit of a gold bug 
[He (PRP)| Mr Alan Greenspan (NNP)] claimed that the gold price was a good indicator of inflation pressures and even expressed nostalgia for the financial rigour induced by the 19th century Gold Standard 
[His (PRP$)| Mr Alan Greenspan (NNP)] views on the role of central banks are sometimes misunderstood 
When Mr Gordon Brown , the UK shadow chancellor , passed through Washington recently , [he (PRP)| Gordon Brown (NNP)] naturally called on Mr Greenspan 
Mr Brown's aides came out of the meeting deeply impressed - Mr Greenspan apparently said the task of a central banks was to promote economic growth as well as to control inflation , thus distancing [himself (PRP)| Mr Alan Greenspan (NNP)] from the sterner rhetoric of [his (PRP$)| Mr Alan Greenspan (NNP)] European colleagues 
Sensitive to [his (PRP$)| Mr Gordon Brown (NNP)] audience , Mr Greenspan probably failed to add that [his (PRP$)| Mr Gordon Brown (NNP)] recipe for stimulating growth is to push for zero inflation or price stability - not a policy that the British Labour party is likely to endorse 
Mr Greenspan defines price stability as inflation so low that it can be ignored because [it (PRP)| price stability as inflation (NN)] no longer interferes with the microeconomic role of relative prices in guiding resource allocation 
[He (PRP)| Mr Alan Greenspan (NNP)] does not think the US has yet reached this goal even though many economists believe the true rate of inflation is lower than the 2.5 per cent to 3 per cent shown by the consumer price index 
If Mr Greenspan fears anything more than inflation , [it (PRP)| this goal (NN)] is financial instability 
[He (PRP)| Mr Alan Greenspan (NNP)] reacted to the 1987 stock market crash in textbook fashion by making unlimited liquidity available to endangered financial institutions 
[He (PRP)| Mr Alan Greenspan (NNP)] cut interest rates more rapidly in the early 1990s than most central banks thought prudent because [he (PRP)| Mr Alan Greenspan (NNP)] feared the combination of excessive borrowing in the 1980s and falling real estate prices might threaten the stability of the US banking system 
With hindsight the Fed's policy looks finely judged : the US has emerged strongly from recession and inflation , so far , has stayed subdued 
Cutting interest rates is easy 
But Mr Greenspan has now embarked on what may prove a long upward path 
During the recession [his (PRP$)| Mr Alan Greenspan (NNP)] gradualist approach - lots of small quarter or , occasionally , half point interest rate cuts - worked well 
If the financial markets discounted future cuts all well and good : share and bond prices simply surged , providing an additional economic stimulus 
But Mr Greenspan is now discovering that gradualism on the way up is a little more problematic 
The Fed hoped that by raising short-term rates promptly [it (PRP)| The US Federal Reserve (NNP)] would convince markets that it was serious about preventing a resurgence of inflation as the recovery matures 
In theory greater confidence that inflation would remain low ought to have countered upward pressure on long bond yields caused by higher borrowing needs as companies expand capacity to meet increased demand 
But this has not happened mainly because markets are betting that Mr Greenspan's gradualist strategy will involve many future rate rises 
Some Wall Street analysts are urging the Fed to act more boldly 
If , instead of nudging rates higher , Mr Greenspan quickly raised rates to a neutral level consistent with sustainable non-inflationary growth , say 4-5 per cent , markets might regain [their (PRP$)| Some Wall Street analysts (NNS)] composure 
On this view , nothing is more destabilising than the present drip drip approach which critics dub Chinese water torture 
While occasionally quibbling with [his (PRP$)| Mr Alan Greenspan (NNP)] judgments , Wall Street nevertheless regards Mr Greenspan as a class act 
[He (PRP)| Mr Alan Greenspan (NNP)] has more than filled the shoes of [his (PRP$)| Mr Alan Greenspan (NNP)] admired predecessor Paul Volcker , partly because [he (PRP)| Mr Alan Greenspan (NNP)] brought diverse qualities to the top Fed job : intimate knowledge of financial markets gleaned from decades as a Wall Street consultant , mastery of economic theory , and prior experience in public service - during the mid-1970s [he (PRP)| Mr Alan Greenspan (NNP)] was chairman of Gerald Ford's council of economic advisers 
None of the people mentioned by Clinton aides as possible successors can match this experience - another reason why nerves are on edge in financial markets 
For example , Mr Robert Rubin , the director of the National Economic Council , is a respected former co-chairman of Goldman Sachs , but [he (PRP)| Robert Rubin (NNP)] lacks Mr Greenspan's economic expertise 
Mr Larry Summers , the Treasury undersecretary , is another potential candidate , but [he (PRP)| Larry Summers (NNP)] lacks practical experience of financial markets 
And although [he (PRP)| Larry Summers (NNP)] was an economics professor [he (PRP)| Larry Summers (NNP)] has a reputation as an inflation dove 
Mr Greenspan's critics should perhaps realise that the financial outlook would be darker if [he (PRP)| Mr Alan Greenspan (NNP)] were less eager to nip inflation in the bud 
US interest rates might not be rising now , but if the economy was allowed to hurtle into capacity constraints , [they (PRP)| Mr Greenspan's critics (NNS)] would eventually be forced into the stratosphere 
Unless Mr Clinton makes an inspired choice (which could involve reaching out to a Republican ), the expiration in 1996 of Mr Greenspan's second term as Fed chairman could spell the end of a long period of US monetary stability
