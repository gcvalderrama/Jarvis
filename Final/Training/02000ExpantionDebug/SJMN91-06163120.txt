As the race for the Russian presidency entered [its (PRP$)| the race for the Russian presidency (NN)] last days , the campaign turned dirty , with newspaper allegations that front-runner Boris Yeltsin is emotionally unstable , that [he (PRP)| front-runner Boris Yeltsin (NNP)] tried to commit suicide in late 1987 and that [he (PRP)| front-runner Boris Yeltsin (NNP)] is still receiving psychological assistance. ; The charges were contained in an article published in Pravda , the Soviet Communist Party newspaper , and in a story published Saturday by Sovietskaya Rossiya , a conservative daily published by the Russian Communist Party 
Russians vote Wednesday in the first democratic elections for the presidency of the huge Russian Republic as well as for the mayors of Moscow , Leningrad and other cities. ; In Moscow on Monday , an estimated 30,000 people marched through the streets in a show of support for Yeltsin , carrying balloons and photos of their candidate and urging Russians to vote for [him (PRP)| their candidate (NN)] 
World chess champion Gary Kasparov spoke in Yeltsin's behalf. ; Just before the first of the negative articles appeared , Yeltsin's aides privately charged that Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev personally had ordered a KGB smear against Yeltsin 
Though Yeltsin's staff would not repeat the allegations publicly , the cycle of smear and recrimination indicated that the rapprochement between Yeltsin and Gorbachev is little more than skin deep. ; [It (PRP)| the cycle of smear and recrimination (NN)] also indicated growing desperation on the part of the Soviet leadership as [it (PRP)| the cycle of smear and recrimination (NN)] watched Yeltsin build an apparently unassailable lead 
If Yeltsin failed to win an absolute majority , [he (PRP)| front-runner Boris Yeltsin (NNP)] would be forced into a runoff with his main opponent , former Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov 
[It (PRP)| a runoff with his main opponent , former Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov (NN)] is a matter of debate whether Yeltsin will face a runoff. ; The Pravda article , purporting to be a psychological study of Yeltsin by four academics , mentioned a suicide attempt at a time when his party career was finished 
The assertion was used to buttress a claim that Yeltsin was particularly unstable under stress. ; The main feature of Boris Nikolayevich's personality is [his (PRP$)| Boris Nikolayevich's (NNP)] excessive need for power , the professors wrote. ; Throughout [his (PRP$)| front-runner Boris Yeltsin (NNP)] career , Yeltsin has shown [himself (PRP)| front-runner Boris Yeltsin (NNP)] to be simplistic , disloyal and , above all , authoritarian , the professors said , and [his (PRP$)| front-runner Boris Yeltsin (NNP)] striving for power shows an unconscious striving to compensate for feelings of inadequacy 
; The suicide story was developed at greater length in Sovietskaya Rossiya by former dissident Roy Medvedev , now a conservative member of the Soviet Parliament 
Medvedev supports Ryzhkov for president. ; In a stinging attack on Yeltsin for hypocrisy and opportunism , Medvedev declared that in late 1987 Yeltsin even attempted to commit suicide with a pair of sharp scissors used for cutting paper 
This was a serious nervous breakdown 
; Medvedev alleged that the incident took place soon after a stormy meeting of the Communist Party Central Committee in October 1987
