Populist reformer Boris N. Yeltsin won the presidency of the largest Soviet republic Tuesday , overcoming opposition by Mikhail S. Gorbachev and declaring the start of Russia's social , economic and spiritual rebirth 
Yeltsin's election , after three hard-fought ballots in the Congress of People's Deputies of the Russian Federation , poses a substantial challenge to Gorbachev and may spur more radical reforms across the country 
Gorbachev , who arrives Wednesday in Washington for a summit , retains the two most powerful jobs in the country : president of the Soviet Union and General Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party 
But as president of the largest of 15 Soviet republics , Yeltsin will have a highly visible platform from which to wage [his (PRP$)| president of the largest of 15 Soviet republics (NN)] campaign for more radical reforms 
Yeltsin and other Soviet officials said [they (PRP)| Yeltsin and other Soviet officials (NNP)] believe [his (PRP$)| Boris N. Yeltsin (NNP)] election will help Gorbachev push more radical reforms 
[It (PRP)| Yeltsin's election (NN)] may be a blessing in disguise , Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov told reporters at the United Nations in New York 
Gorbachev has [his (PRP$)| Mikhail S. Gorbachev (NNP)] critics from both the left and the right , and possibly it is better to have the election of a critic from the left 
Yeltsin said : At first , President Gorbachev will react very unhappily , but then [he (PRP)| Mikhail S. Gorbachev (NNP)] will gradually get used to this inevitability 
The strapping , white-haired Yeltsin told reporters that [he (PRP)| Boris N. Yeltsin (NNP)] would seek reconciliation with Gorbachev and avoid confrontation with [him (PRP)| Boris N. Yeltsin (NNP)] , so long as it did not hurt Russia's interests 
Gorbachev had brought Yeltsin to Moscow to head the city's Communist Party , but the two men had a falling out in 1987 after Yeltsin publicly criticized the pace of Kremlin reforms 
[They (PRP)| the two men (NNS)] have been at odds since then 
After the vote result was announced in the Grand Kremlin Palace , Yeltsin strode to the podium to warm applause and pledged to spare nothing _ health or time _ to get out of this crisis and lead Russia to better times 
[His (PRP$)| Boris N. Yeltsin (NNP)] bass voice echoing through the hall , [he (PRP)| Boris N. Yeltsin (NNP)] called the day the beginning of the road to Russia's social , economic and spiritual rebirth , the way out of the crisis and toward the blossoming of Russia as a sovereign , independent government in the framework of [our (PRP$)| the two men (NNS)] union 
[He (PRP)| Boris N. Yeltsin (NNP)] left through the Kremlin gates later to the tumultuous cheers of a small crowd of well-wishers chanting Victory ! 
Victory ! 
One man yelled , Thank you , thank you for the future ! 
Gorbachev strongly opposed Yeltsin's election 
[He (PRP)| Mikhail S. Gorbachev (NNP)] told the Russian Congress last week that Yeltsin's platform of moving political and economic power from central to local authorities would lead to a breakup of the union 
The Russian Federation stretches from the Baltic Sea in the west to the Pacific Ocean in the East 
[It (PRP)| the Russian Federation (NNP)] is home to half the country's 285 million people and includes Moscow , the Soviet capital 
As president of the Russian Congress , a newly created body that holds the Russian Federation's highest government authority , Yeltsin acts as chief executive of the republic and took office immediately 
As the first president of a newly reorganized legislature , [he (PRP)| the first president of a newly reorganized legislature (NN)] will play a major role in shaping [his (PRP$)| the first president of a newly reorganized legislature (NN)] powers and duties , which as yet are unclear 
After three votes in the 1,060-member Russian Congress , Yeltsin won 535 votes , four more than the majority needed 
Russian Premier Alexander Vlasov received 467 votes 
Valentin Tsoy , a little-known businessman from the Soviet Far East , received 11 votes 
Lawmakers said Tuesday [they (PRP)| Lawmakers (NNS)] believed Yeltsin gained the last few votes [he (PRP)| Boris N. Yeltsin (NNP)] needed by offering to form a coalition government with members of the conservative Communist Party bloc and other groups 
Yeltsin said [he (PRP)| Boris N. Yeltsin (NNP)] believed [he (PRP)| Boris N. Yeltsin (NNP)] gained several votes because of a last-minute push by Gorbachev to block [his (PRP$)| Boris N. Yeltsin (NNP)] election 
Gorbachev reportedly urged delegates at a meeting Monday night not to vote for Yeltsin 
Russian Deputy Alexander Liubimov , a well-known TV commentator , said Yeltsin's election would force Gorbachev to start dealing with another strong leader instead of shadows willing to defer to [him (PRP)| Mikhail S. Gorbachev (NNP)] 
[It (PRP)| Yeltsin's election (NN)] will be a lesson for [him (PRP)| Alexander Liubimov (NNP)] 
Maybe a hard one , Liubimov said 
Vitaly Churkin , a spokesman for Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze , said on NBC that Yeltsin's election might actually help Gorbachev because Gorbachev is for radical reform , and [he (PRP)| Eduard A. Shevardnadze (NNP)] needs more popular support for that 
Some also said Yeltsin may have benefited from the adverse reaction to the Kremlin's proposed program for making the crippled Soviet economy a partial market economy 
The reform program , which would triple the price of bread on July 1 and double the cost of other foodstuffs starting Jan. 1 , caused panic buying that prompted Moscow city authorities to bar sales to non-residents of the capital Monday 
The national legislature postponed a decision on the reform plan Tuesday , raising the possibility of compromise with Yeltsin and others demanding more radical measures 
[It (PRP)| The national legislature (NN)] also rejected a motion for a no-confidence vote in Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov , who presented the reforms last week 
Yeltsin has proposed a more rapid transition to a market-based economy that would grant more freedom to enterprises and entrepreneurs
