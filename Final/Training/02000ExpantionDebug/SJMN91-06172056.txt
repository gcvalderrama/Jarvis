White House Chief of Staff John Sununu was marching down a hall next to the Senate chamber last fall when [he (PRP)| White House Chief of Staff John Sununu (NNP)] encountered Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady walking in the opposite direction , trailed by a couple of reporters. ; Not even pausing , Sununu barked at Brady to turn around and follow [him (PRP)| Staff John Sununu (NNP)] 
The tall , patrician Brady stood stiffly in silence for a moment , obviously irked at being addressed like a junior staff member , as Sununu continued walking without waiting for a response 
No , no , John , Brady called out 
YOU are going the wrong way 
Reproached , Sununu reversed tracks and followed the Cabinet secretary. ; These days , Sununu seems to be making a habit of going the wrong way : The latest flap is over [his (PRP$)| Staff John Sununu (NNP)] taking a chauffeur-driven White House car to New York to attend a stamp auction. ; And the abrasive chief of staff is discovering that the dozens of people [he (PRP)| the abrasive chief of staff (NN)] has insulted or slighted from administration officials to members of Congress are watching [his (PRP$)| the abrasive chief of staff (NN)] travails with thinly disguised relish. ; Before , Sununu could take comfort in unswerving support from the person who mattered : President Bush 
But now , that too is in doubt. ; Bush gave Sununu a less-than-ringing endorsement Wednesday , telling reporters that the former New Hampshire governor has created an appearance problem 
; And suddenly , the political community is abuzz with questions about how long Sununu will last in [his (PRP$)| Staff John Sununu (NNP)] job and how someone so bright could get [himself (PRP)| someone so bright (NN)] in so much trouble. ; Sununu's latest problems stem from [his (PRP$)| Staff John Sununu (NNP)] use of [his (PRP$)| Staff John Sununu (NNP)] official car to go to New York for a stamp auction 
There was nothing illegal about the trip , or Sununu's ride home on a corporate jet after attending a GOP fund-raiser in New Jersey later that night. ; But the incident raises questions about Sununu's judgment because [it (PRP)| the political community (NN)] came only a few weeks after reports of [his (PRP$)| Staff John Sununu (NNP)] use of government jets for personal and political purposes. ; Besides triggering a spate of unflattering attention , those reports prompted a new , more-restrictive White House travel policy that required Sununu to get advance approval for [his (PRP$)| Staff John Sununu (NNP)] flights. ; The latest flap has dominated White House briefings the past two days and prompted Bush to suggest Wednesday that Sununu should not use [his (PRP$)| Staff John Sununu (NNP)] government car for such purposes again. ; [I (PRP)| President Bush (NNP)] recognize , and [I (PRP)| President Bush (NNP)] think the governor (Sununu )does , there is an appearance problem , said Bush , who nonetheless defended Sununu's use of the car as permissible in this case and said Sununu's job was safe. ; White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater , amplifying Bush's comments , made [it (PRP)| the political community (NN)] clear that Bush had told Sununu that [he (PRP)| Staff John Sununu (NNP)] was concerned by the appearance of impropriety and that [he (PRP)| Staff John Sununu (NNP)] wanted [his (PRP$)| Staff John Sununu (NNP)] chief of staff to take no more embarrassing trips. ; Fitzwater said Bush expects such use of a White House car to be a one-time-only thing ... 
[We (PRP)| reporters (NNS)] only expect [it (PRP)| GOP (NNP)] to happen once 
; The controversy is unquestionably an embarrassment for Bush , who has prided [himself (PRP)| President Bush (NNP)] on setting a high ethical standard for [his (PRP$)| President Bush (NNP)] administration 
And some former White House officials say Sununu should recognize that [he (PRP)| Staff John Sununu (NNP)] is not serving Bush well. ; In light of [his (PRP$)| Staff John Sununu (NNP)] problems with [his (PRP$)| Staff John Sununu (NNP)] jet travel and all that , [he (PRP)| Staff John Sununu (NNP)] ought to be a little careful , said Lyn Nofziger , a White House political director under Ronald Reagan 
If not for his sake , then for the sake of the president 
[It (PRP)| his sake (NN)] is the president who has to run for re-election next year , not John Sununu 
; As Sununu [himself (PRP)| the president who has to run for re-election next year , not John Sununu (NN)] has noted , some of the criticism goes with the job of saying no to administration officials and lawmakers who want the president's ear. ; Somebody has to be the tougher hand , the firmer hand 
It goes with the territory , Sununu said last month. ; But critics complain that Sununu's brusque style has alienated Republicans and Democrats needlessly , causing unnecessary ill will. ; [He (PRP)| Staff John Sununu (NNP)] publicly dismissed Sen. Trent Lott , R-Miss. , as an insignificant figure last year during the budget debate on Capitol Hill 
[He (PRP)| Staff John Sununu (NNP)] has enraged House Republicans by dressing [them (PRP)| critics (NNS)] down privately and questioning [their (PRP$)| critics (NNS)] political skills
