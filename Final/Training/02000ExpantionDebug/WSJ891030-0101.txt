Federal Reserve critics used to complain of stop and go monetary policies 
[They (PRP)| Federal Reserve critics (NNS)] claimed that the Fed would first give a green light to the economy by making credit readily available and then turn on the red and bring growth to a screeching halt 
But under Alan Greenspan that has changed 
A supremely cautious man , the Fed chairman is forever blinking yellow 
Indeed , [his (PRP$)| A supremely cautious man , the Fed chairman (NN)] caution has become legendary within the government 
[He (PRP)| A supremely cautious man , the Fed chairman (NN)] fusses endlessly over economic statistics , dissecting [them (PRP)| Federal Reserve critics (NNS)] in dozens of ways , probing for hours in search of potential problems 
After thoroughly digesting reams of information , [he (PRP)| A supremely cautious man , the Fed chairman (NN)] often concludes that more data are needed , and when [he (PRP)| A supremely cautious man , the Fed chairman (NN)] finally decides to act , [his (PRP$)| A supremely cautious man , the Fed chairman (NN)] movements sometimes seem excrutiatingly small 
Such caution was evident after the recent Friday-the-13th stock market plunge 
Some Bush administration officials urged Mr. Greenspan to make an immediate public announcement of [his (PRP$)| Alan Greenspan (NNP)] plans to provide ample credit to the markets 
But [he (PRP)| Bush (NNP)] refused , claiming that [he (PRP)| Bush (NNP)] wanted to see what happened Monday morning before making any public statement 
Mr. Greenspan's decision to keep quiet also prompted a near-mutiny within the Fed's ranks 
A senior Fed official spoke on Saturday after the market swoon to both the Washington Post and the New York Times , saying the Fed was prepared to provide as much credit as the markets needed 
The statement angered Chairman Greenspan , but [it (PRP)| The statement (NN)] was greeted with applause by the Bush administration and the financial markets 
And , while the mutinous Fed member has not gone public , some Fed governors , most notably Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson , are known to have disagreed with the chairman's decision to remain silent 
Ironically , the anonymous official's comments have earned some plaudits for Mr. Greenspan , who is mistakenly seen as the source 
At a hearing last week , Democratic Sen. Chris Dodd of Connecticut told Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady that Chairman Greenspan's announcement over the Oct. 13 weekend was a very important statement 
Mr. Brady hesitantly replied that [he (PRP)| Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady (NNP)] was not sure whether Mr. Greenspan made a statement [himself (PRP)| Alan Greenspan (NNP)] , or whether that was a newspaper report 
The Fed chairman's caution was apparent again on the Monday morning after the market's plunge , when the central bank took only modest steps to aid the markets 
A surprisingly small amount of reserves was added to the banking system 
And , by the end of that week , the key federal funds interest rate , which is largely controlled by the Fed , had settled at 8.75 % , barely changed from the level of just under 9 % that prevailed the previous week 
Bush administration officials appear increasingly concerned that Mr. Greenspan is cautious to a fault 
Signs of growing weakness in the economy , paired with indications that inflation is staying well under control , have caused [them (PRP)| Some Bush administration officials (NNS)] to wonder why the Fed chairman is so grudging in reducing rates 
Those concerns are not expressed in public 
In fact , the administration and the Fed have been going out of [their (PRP$)| Some Bush administration officials (NNS)] way in the past two weeks to dispel any impression that [they (PRP)| Some Bush administration officials (NNS)] are at odds , fearing stories about an administration-Fed split added to the stock market's jitters 
Still , the split is there 
The administration's concerns are understandable 
The economy is showing signs of weakness , particularly among manufacturers 
Exports , which played a key role in fueling growth over the last two years , seem to have stalled 
Factory payrolls and production fell in September , and the auto industry and housing are in a severe crunch 
But Mr. Greenspan remains reluctant to loosen policy , partly because [he (PRP)| Alan Greenspan (NNP)] faces a phalanx of presidents of regional Fed banks who oppose credit easing 
In addition , the chairman has a wary eye aimed a year or two down the road 
Inflation may be stable at the moment , running at about 4.5 % 
But if the Fed eases too soon , Mr. Greenspan fears , prices may begin to accelerate again next year 
Moreover , if the Fed holds tight , it may be able gradually to reduce inflation , moving toward the zero-inflation goal that the Fed chairman embraced in testimony to Congress last week 
So far , Mr. Greenspan's cautious approach to policy has served both him and the nation well 
[His (PRP$)| Alan Greenspan (NNP)] hand on the monetary tiller seems one reason why the economy next month seems highly likely to begin an unprecedented eighth year of peacetime growth without a recession 
We have gotten through two stock market crashes , and we have gone through an election without any major problems , says David Hale , an economist of Kemper Financial Services 
[I (PRP)| David Hale (NNP)] think you have to give Greenspan a good rating 
But such caution is no guarantee against mistakes 
The Fed's reluctance to ease credit now could be laying the groundwork for a new recession , perhaps starting early next year 
If that happens , Chairman Greenspan could well become an open target 
Already , Congress is toying with legislation to curb the Fed's independence 
If the economy turns down , such proposals could gain strong momentum
