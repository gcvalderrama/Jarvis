Columbia Savings & Loan Association has filed a $ 6 billion civil lawsuit accusing Michael Milken and other former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. officials of fraudulently peddling junk bonds in the 1980s 
The lawsuit , filed Wednesday by the failing savings and loan , claims that Milken and others manipulated and coerced Columbia and other thrifts into buying billions of dollars worth of the risky high-yield bonds 
Absent such deceit and manipulations [it (PRP)| a $ 6 billion civil lawsuit accusing Michael Milken and other former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. officials of fraudulently peddling junk bonds in the 1980s (NN)] would have been clear that the market for junk bonds was highly illiquid and that junk bonds were unsuitable investments for savings and loan institutions , the suit says 
Columbia once was a major Drexel customer 
[It (PRP)| Columbia (NNP)] holds a junk bond portfolio with a face value of over $ 4 billion , the largest of any thrift 
Milken had a close business relationship with former Columbia chairman Thomas Spiegel , who resigned last year 
Milken , the former head of Drexel's Beverly Hills , Calif.-based junk bond department , was sentenced last month to 10 years in prison for six felonies related to illegal trading practices 
None of the charges involved junk bonds 
The lawsuit by Columbia , filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles , names Milken , nine other Drexel officials and more than 100 investment partnerships sponsored by the collapsed Wall Street firm 
[It (PRP)| the Milken lawsuit (NN)] alleges that the thrift lost more than $ 2 billion on investments in junk bonds and seeks three times that amount under federal racketeering and antitrust laws 
Columbia , based in Beverly Hills , said in the lawsuit that Milken and other Drexel officials manipulated , coerced and deceived the thrift by promising that the market for the bonds would remain active and the thrift would make money 
In a statement , a spokesman for Milken said the lawsuit was without merit 
The statement said Columbia was an independent institution that made [its (PRP$)| Columbia (NNP)] own investment decisions , often in disagreement with Milken 
It is outrageous now to blame Michael Milken for losses as a result of strategies and decisions that were implemented long after [he (PRP)| Michael Milken for losses (NNP)] was no longer active at Drexel Burnham Lambert , and which [he (PRP)| Michael Milken for losses (NNP)] did not endorse or agree with , the statement said 
Milken resigned from Drexel last year but the statement said [he (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] had gradually reduced [his (PRP$)| Michael Milken (NNP)] day-to-day activity after [he (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] was linked to the government's Wall Street investigation in late 1986 
[It (PRP)| Drexel (NNP)] said the lawsuit amounts to shifting the blame to the most convenient scapegoat on the financial scene - Michael Milken - who has been blamed for every problem facing the U.S. economy except the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait 
The lawsuit joins scores of other civil complaints against Milken for alleged wrongdoing related to [his (PRP$)| Michael Milken (NNP)] guilty plea as well as other trading activity during [his (PRP$)| Michael Milken (NNP)] tenure at Drexel , which is now in federal bankruptcy court proceedings 
The 176-page lawsuit by Columbia also claims that Milken and other Drexel employees appropriated stock in buyouts for [themselves (PRP)| Milken and other Drexel employees (NNP)] via the investment partnerships that should have gone to junk bond buyers in the deals 
The suit accuses Milken and others of manipulating the junk bond market , giving bribes and stock investment opportunities to some thrift executives , misappropriating valuable stock interests in junk bond deals , skimming profits from junk bond trading , and controlling through illegal means a web of thrifts and other investors in junk bonds 
Columbia was one of many savings and loans , big investors and other institutions that invested heavily in deals financed or supported by Drexel in the 1980s 
Columbia says in the suit that [its (PRP$)| Columbia (NNP)] junk bonds have a total face value of $ 4.3 billion , but that [it (PRP)| Columbia (NNP)] has written down [their (PRP$)| big investors (NNS)] value to $ 2.5 billion to account for the decline in [their (PRP$)| big investors (NNS)] market price 
[It (PRP)| Columbia (NNP)] also says [it (PRP)| Columbia (NNP)] has suffered actual losses of $ 200 million through the sale of some bonds 
The suit says Columbia was ill-equipped to make use of relaxed federal laws in the early 1980s that allowed thrifts to invest in corporate securities such as junk bonds 
[It (PRP)| the suit (NN)] alleges that Milken and the others exploited this weakness 
The savings and loan is expected to be take over soon by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. as part of the nation's costly thrift bailout 
The FDIC and Resolution Trust Corp. , which administers the failed thrifts , already have filed a claim for $ 4.5 billion against Drexel in federal bankruptcy court alleging that fraudulent junk bond dealings caused Columbia heavy losses 
Also named in the Milken lawsuit are former Drexel chief executive Frederick Joseph ; Milken's brother , Lowell , also a former Drexel executive ; Peter Ackerman , Drexel's former chief of capital markets ; and other officials 
As part of [his (PRP$)| Michael Milken (NNP)] settlement of criminal and civil charges by the government , Milken has agreed to place $ 400 million in a fund to compensate investors harmed by [his (PRP$)| Michael Milken (NNP)] actions 
But [he (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] would remain liable for awards exceeding the amount in the fund
