A statewide coalition of law enforcement officials , formed last fall to respond to what [they (PRP)| law enforcement officials (NNS)] see as the proliferation of military-type semiautomatic firearms among street gangs and drug dealers , has nearly completed the task of drafting legislation to outlaw the manufacture and sale of such guns 
As [they (PRP)| law enforcement officials (NNS)] prepare for a showdown in the Legislature with the powerful gun lobby , the coalition whose leaders include Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp , Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block and Alameda County Dist 
Atty. John J. Meehan has made passage of the bill [its (PRP$)| passage of the bill (NN)] top priority of the year 
If law enforcement does not attempt to do something about [it (PRP)| law enforcement (NN)] now , [we (PRP)| law enforcement officials (NNS)] are just going to have a whole higher level of arms race in California , and [it (PRP)| law enforcement (NN)] is going to be extremely dangerous for innocent people , said Richard Inglehart , an Alameda County prosecutor and member of the task force drafting the legislation 
The legislation is aimed at semiautomatic rifles like the Uzi , AK-47 and AR-15 , available over the counter to anyone 18 or older who provides identification and fills out a form declaring that [he (PRP)| AK-47 (NNP)] is not a drug addict , a fugitive or a mentally unstable person 
By contrast , purchasers of handguns must wait 15 days for a state background investigation before taking possession of [their (PRP$)| purchasers of handguns (NNS)] firearms 
A bruising fight with the politically powerful National Rifle Assn. and the Gun Owners of California seems assured 
Traditionally , the Legislature has been reluctant to enact anything that smacks of controls on guns or firearm ownership 
Former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. once observed that in California , [you (PRP)| Richard Inglehart , an Alameda County prosecutor and member of the task force drafting the legislation (NNP)] do not mess with a man's guns or cars 
[It (PRP)| California (NNP)] will be one of the donnybrooks of the legislative session , predicted Gary Mullen , executive director of the California District Attorneys Assn. , of the campaign that will pit the NRA against the police 
Lobbyist David Marshall of the NRA , a veteran of previous unsuccessful attempts to outlaw military-type semiautomatics , maintains that a prohibition against such firearms will not deter criminals intent on getting [them (PRP)| military-type semiautomatics (NNS)] but will work to the disadvantage of law-abiding Californians 
Leave the law-abiding citizen alone , [he (PRP)| Lobbyist David Marshall of the NRA (NNP)] said 
Go after the criminals and nail [them (PRP)| the criminals (NNS)] to the wall and stop treating [them (PRP)| the criminals (NNS)] with kid gloves 
Get [them (PRP)| the criminals (NNS)] off the streets 
Give [them (PRP)| the criminals (NNS)] mandatory jail time 
No plea-bargaining 
No probation 
No parole 
Popular Military Type Increasingly , the weapon of choice for drug dealers and street gangs is the military-style semiautomatic gun that often is easily concealed and can be converted to a full automatic 
At semiautomatic , the rifle fires one bullet at a time as fast as the trigger is pulled 
On automatic , one squeeze sends out a stream of fire like a machine gun's 
Under a law sponsored by the NRA , it is illegal in California to convert a semiautomatic to a full automatic 
Likewise , it is illegal to possess a machine gun without a permit from the attorney general 
The drafters of the proposed law enforcement gun bill say [they (PRP)| The drafters of the proposed law enforcement gun bill (NNS)] are close to agreement on language in the bill that would outlaw the manufacture and sale of certain bad guns but exempt good guns those used by hunters , competitive target shooters and collectors 
The difficulty is in distinguishing between semiautomatic military weapons and the semiautomatic rifles and shotguns used by sportsmen , because all operate on basically the same principle 
Broad Definition The bill would establish a broad generic definition that would fit military assault-type semiautomatics and be based on such things as the length of barrel and size of the bullet magazine 
Some existing weapons would actually be banned by name 
However , certain sporting guns that may resemble the prohibited firearms would be exempted by name 
The legislation would allow manufacturers of the military-style weapons to obtain a permit to sell the guns that is similar to what is required for machine guns 
In general , however , [they (PRP)| manufacturers of the military-style weapons (NNS)] would not be allowed to sell to civilian outlets in California 
A commission would be created to approve or reject new guns that come on the market in the future 
The commission , as yet of unspecified membership , could add prohibited guns to the list , which sponsors said would be short , at least initially 
The bill , which has undergone at least 10 drafts , is expected to be introduced next month 
No legislator has yet been asked to carry the measure , proponents said , although Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles )has promised to author such a bill 
Strategists for the task force conceded that assuring hunters , collectors and sportsmen that their guns are safe and would not be affected by the bill is a key element in winning [its (PRP$)| the bill (NN)] approval by a Legislature highly sensitive to gun-owning constituents 
[We (PRP)| Strategists for the task force (NNS)] want to make sure the bill does not affect hunters and sportsmen , even though the NRA will take [it (PRP)| the politically powerful National Rifle Assn. (NNP)] on and be opposed to [it (PRP)| the politically powerful National Rifle Assn. (NNP)] , said prosecutor Inglehart 
But there are some guns that are not designed or meant to be used for hunting 
Sheriff Block , an outspoken opponent of semiautomatic assault weapons , said [he (PRP)| Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block (NNP)] believes there is a need to selectively regulate and , if necessary , prohibit certain kinds of weaponry in the interests of public safety 
These weapons are legally available 
People have exercised what is a right under the law (to purchase [them (PRP)| innocent people (NNS)] )and [I (PRP)| Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block (NNP)] think the law has to be changed 
Retired Senator Active Joining in the fight against the legislation will be the Gun Owners of California , a political action committee headed by retired Sen. H. L. Richardson 
The Glendora Republican now is in the business of producing conservative political videos 
Richardson said [he (PRP)| retired Sen. H. L. Richardson (NNP)] intends to blanket the state with thousands of videos opposing the legislation , just as [he (PRP)| retired Sen. H. L. Richardson (NNP)] did when [he (PRP)| retired Sen. H. L. Richardson (NNP)] campaigned for the defeat of former state Supreme Court Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird 
Gun control advocates , who were active in earlier attempts to outlaw military-type semiautomatic rifles , have made the tactical decision to remain on the sidelines in this struggle 
For many gun owners and legislators , gun control is a code phrase for confiscating firearms 
[We (PRP)| many gun owners and legislators (NNS)] are taking [our (PRP$)| many gun owners and legislators (NNS)] cue from law enforcement and looking to [them (PRP)| Gun control advocates (NNS)] for leadership on this issue , said Louis Tolley , state director of Handgun Control Inc. [We (PRP)| many gun owners and legislators (NNS)] are very anxious to support [them (PRP)| Gun control advocates (NNS)] 
[They (PRP)| Gun control advocates (NNS)] have the expertise in defining these assault weapons and how best to restrict them 
[We (PRP)| many gun owners and legislators (NNS)] do not have that expertise
