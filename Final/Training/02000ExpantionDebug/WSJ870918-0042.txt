If Robert Bork's Supreme Court confirmation hearings this week can be said to have had a moment of epiphany , [it (PRP)| Supreme Court (NNP)] came Wednesday morning 
That is when Judge Bork was explaining to Sen. Alan Simpson how Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes , the famous civil libertarian , had once upheld a law that allowed the sterilization of the mentally retarded 
Three generations of imbeciles are enough , Holmes had written , in what Judge Bork described , in charitable understatement , as not (Holmes's )finest hour 
Sen. Simpson then paused for a moment , looked around at his colleagues , and quipped , Perhaps [we (PRP)| his colleagues (NNS)] ought to bring [him (PRP)| Sen. Alan Simpson how Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes , the famous civil libertarian , had once upheld a law that allowed the sterilization of the mentally retarded (NNP)] back up here , and the hearing room broke up in laughter 
Sen. Simpson has a searing wit , but the unfunny truth is that , having written that phrase , even the eminent Justice Holmes would have trouble making [it (PRP)| phrase , even the eminent Justice Holmes (NN)] through the political swamp that passes for today's Senate confirmation process 
Justice Holmes would have spent much of his confirmation battle explaining how [it (PRP)| his confirmation battle (NN)] was that [he (PRP)| Sen. Alan Simpson how Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes , the famous civil libertarian , had once upheld a law that allowed the sterilization of the mentally retarded (NNP)] could hold such benighted views , and defending why [he (PRP)| Sen. Alan Simpson how Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes , the famous civil libertarian , had once upheld a law that allowed the sterilization of the mentally retarded (NNP)] really was not prejudiced against the handicapped 
Judge Bork is not Justice Holmes , though [he (PRP)| Judge Bork (NNP)] is probably one of the half-dozen best qualified Supreme Court nominees since Holmes 
[He (PRP)| Judge Bork (NNP)] is surely the most prolific , as well , and so the capital's standing army of activists and senators has this week been busily replaying everything [he (PRP)| Judge Bork (NNP)] ever wrote or said , all in an attempt to prove [he (PRP)| Judge Bork (NNP)] is a judicial extremist , a threat to the republic 
Judge Bork defended [himself (PRP)| Judge Bork (NNP)] well this week , with scholarly precision and often with humor , but in Washington reasonableness alone is not enough to win a seat on the Court 
By now , the politics of judicial appointment in the Reagan years has become drearily predictable , like a Herblock cartoon 
Any nominee at all at odds with the judicial orthodoxy of recent decades is immediately attacked as someone out of Invasion of the Body Snatchers 
The essential weapons are , as Sen. Simpson put [it (PRP)| the judicial orthodoxy of recent decades (NN)] in [his (PRP$)| Sen. Alan Simpson how Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes , the famous civil libertarian , had once upheld a law that allowed the sterilization of the mentally retarded (NNP)] opening statement , a deft blend of emotion , fear , guilt or racism 
The idea is to raise such a public furor about the nominee's extremism that the fanatic moderates who often hold the balance of power in the Senate wo not dare risk guilt by association by voting in favor 
If a nominee's reputation happens to be shredded amid all of this politicking , well , too bad , but that is life in the big city 
The activists started things off by supplying the emotion and fear 
A group known as People for the American Way papered Washington with ads headlining the case of Robert Bork vs. The People , suggesting , apparently , that anyone who supports Judge Bork opposes the people , not to mention the American way 
The same ads implied that Judge Bork had no objection to sterilizing workers , did not believe in any right to privacy , and just might Turn the clock back on civil rights ? 
The question mark was a nice touch , apparently meant to suggest the ad writers might actually have some doubt 
Once the hearings began , the directors of these lobbying groups huddled amid the marble colonnades in the back of the Senate Caucus Room , smiling or wincing as events played out 
Ralph Neas , the amiable leader of the activist troops and the subject of a flattering profile in Tuesday's Washington Post , was always ready with a quote 
[I (PRP)| Ralph Neas (NNP)] think things are going well , [he (PRP)| Ralph Neas (NNP)] would say , time and again 
[We (PRP)| the amiable leader of the activist troops and the subject of a flattering profile in Tuesday's Washington Post (NN)] are laying out the record that shows how extreme [he (PRP)| Ralph Neas , the amiable leader of the activist troops and the subject of a flattering profile in Tuesday's Washington Post (NNP)] is 
The senators [themselves (PRP)| The senators (NNS)] were more respectful , perhaps because [they (PRP)| The senators (NNS)] know that TV cameras have been unkind lately to inquisitors 
Judiciary Chairman Joe Biden appeared to have taken a course from Miss Manners ; [he (PRP)| Judiciary Chairman Joe Biden (NNP)] displayed none of the florid sarcasm that drove Ursula Meese to tears when [her (PRP$)| Ursula Meese (NNP)] husband was seeking to be confirmed as attorney general 
The questioning , however , left little doubt about its goal to suggest that Judge Bork cares not at all for the rights of women , of minorities , of the press , or of pretty much anyone else 
Had not Judge Bork done something illegal , charged Sen. Howard Metzenbaum , by dismissing the Watergate special prosecutor in 1973 ? 
Judge Bork explained as [he (PRP)| Judge Bork (NNP)] has dozens of times before [his (PRP$)| Judge Bork (NNP)] moral dilemma in seeking as solicitor general to follow the orders of a president , yet also keep the special prosecutor team from disbanding 
[He (PRP)| Judge Bork (NNP)] succeeded on both accounts , as the special prosecution force's own final report concluded 
Is not Judge Bork beyond the pale , implied Sen. Biden , for believing there is no right to privacy in the Constitution ? 
Judge Bork had to explain that , yes , there are all kinds of privacy rights in the Constitution (the First , 4th and 5th amendments , for example ), but [he (PRP)| Judge Bork (NNP)] did not believe there is any generalized , undefined right 
Is not Judge Bork in effect a racist because [he (PRP)| Judge Bork in effect (NNP)] once opposed that part of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that outlawed discrimination in public places ? 
implied Sen. Edward Kennedy 
Judge Bork explained that [he (PRP)| Judge Bork (NNP)] was concerned at the time about government coercion in private decisions , but that [he (PRP)| Judge Bork (NNP)] had retracted that position more than a decade ago 
So Americans were left with the spectacle of this distinguished judge and scholar having to plead in public that [he (PRP)| Judge Bork (NNP)] is not a bigot , that , indeed , [he (PRP)| Judge Bork (NNP)] had once persuaded the senior partners in [his (PRP$)| Judge Bork (NNP)] Chicago law firm to end [their (PRP$)| the senior partners (NNS)] quota on Jewish attorneys 
Judge Bork's supporters in the White House believe that all of this helped his cause , that [it (PRP)| his cause (NN)] proved [he (PRP)| Judge Bork (NNP)] was not , as one put it , a neanderthal 
[They (PRP)| Judge Bork's supporters in the White House (NNS)] believe [he (PRP)| Judge Bork (NNP)] has improved [his (PRP$)| Judge Bork (NNP)] chances to win the support of at least one of the three undecided senators on the Judiciary Committee , and thus make [it (PRP)| the support of at least one of the three undecided senators on the Judiciary Committee (NN)] at least to the Senate floor 
If Judge Bork is not confirmed , however , the record of this week suggests that the reason will result less from [his (PRP$)| Judge Bork (NNP)] own failings than from the ferocity and distortions of [his (PRP$)| Judge Bork (NNP)] opponents
