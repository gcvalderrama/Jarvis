In the two years since his appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court was rejected , Robert Bork has found a new forum 
From his base at a conservative think tank he has become a best-selling author and he is soon to hit the lecture circuit 
No , he does not think he will ever get another shot at the high court 
The man who would have been a member of the U.S. Supreme Court and was stingingly rebuffed by the Senate is quick to smile at the irony the last two years have brought 
Robert Heron Bork does not dwell on past disappointments 
In fact , [he (PRP)| The man who would have been a member of the U.S. Supreme Court and was stingingly rebuffed by the Senate (NN)] sees [himself (PRP)| The man who would have been a member of the U.S. Supreme Court and was stingingly rebuffed by the Senate (NN)] having a bigger impact on the law from the sidelines than [he (PRP)| The man who would have been a member of the U.S. Supreme Court and was stingingly rebuffed by the Senate (NN)] would have had from the bench 
[He (PRP)| The man who would have been a member of the U.S. Supreme Court and was stingingly rebuffed by the Senate (NN)] says [he (PRP)| The man who would have been a member of the U.S. Supreme Court and was stingingly rebuffed by the Senate (NN)] is taking [his (PRP$)| The man who would have been a member of the U.S. Supreme Court and was stingingly rebuffed by the Senate (NN)] case to a higher court , the American public and the next generation 
One reason why is that Robert Bork , former Marine , former practicing lawyer , former Yale professor of law , former solicitor general , former professor at Yale again , former judge of the U.S. Circuit of Appeals , is now a best-selling writer 
To [his (PRP$)| Robert Bork (NNP)] surprise , The Tempting of America , The Political Seduction Of The Law , has been on the best-seller list for more than 10 weeks , and there are more than 190,000 copies in print 
Has that vindicated [his (PRP$)| Robert Bork (NNP)] views ? 
[I (PRP)| Robert Bork (NNP)] never felt the need for vindication , [he (PRP)| Robert Bork (NNP)] says with a chuckle 
Bork was nominated for the Supreme Court in July 1987 and four months later the Democrat-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee , after an often vitriolic debate , found him unfit for the job 
[His (PRP$)| Robert Bork (NNP)] strict constructionist views of the Constitution threatened the inclusion of women's rights under the 14th Amendment , and evoked a public outcry from blacks and labor 
In the political undercurrent it was also remembered that Bork as solicitor general dismissed special prosecutor Archibald Cox during the Saturday Night Massacre in the Nixon administration 
Sitting in [his (PRP$)| Bork as solicitor general (NNP)] office at the American Enterprise Institute , [his (PRP$)| Bork as solicitor general (NNP)] back to [his (PRP$)| Bork as solicitor general (NNP)] word processor , [he (PRP)| Bork as solicitor general (NNP)] briefly considers what might have been : [I (PRP)| Bork as solicitor general (NNP)] do not want to spend the rest of my life reliving [it (PRP)| the rest of my life (NN)] 
[I (PRP)| Bork as solicitor general (NNP)] have other things to do 
[He (PRP)| Bork as solicitor general (NNP)] recalls the impact of a book [he (PRP)| Bork as solicitor general (NNP)] wrote a dozen years ago on antitrust law 
A lot of people were good enough to say [it (PRP)| A lot of people (NN)] had a great influence on moving antitrust laws from where [they (PRP)| people (NNS)] were to where [they (PRP)| people (NNS)] are now 
[I (PRP)| Bork as solicitor general (NNP)] hope in the same way to have some effect with this one , [he (PRP)| Bork as solicitor general (NNP)] says , pointing out the antitrust book had a greater impact than a few opinions he might have handed down from the bench 
You know if you are on a court , you are one vote 
And you ca not sit down and write 300 pages of connected argument to show why this is the right approach 
I think this book has the chance to have more impact 
I think I am talking to the next generation 
He says he has has received more than 200 letters from readers , some short , some long , some funny , some analytical , all supporting , he says 
The law reviews have yet to come out , but one university is planning four of them 
The book is also planned for paperback , which should reach a student audience 
Bork has plans for perhaps two more books , one in more academic detail on constitutional law aimed at law schools , and another on the relationship of law and the culture 
[He (PRP)| Robert Bork (NNP)] will hit the lecture circuit this spring and fall and will teach a constitutional law course next year at George Mason University 
Occasionally [he (PRP)| Robert Bork (NNP)] writes magazine commentary articles 
Perhaps another shot at the court ? 
[I (PRP)| Robert Bork (NNP)] do not think so 
[I (PRP)| Robert Bork (NNP)] do not think that is in the cards ... The first time around when [I (PRP)| Robert Bork (NNP)] was nominated for the Court of Appeals , the Senate approved [me (PRP)| Robert Bork (NNP)] unanimously , as did the committee 
But now [he (PRP)| Robert Bork (NNP)] feels the Senate has taken a position on [him (PRP)| Robert Bork (NNP)] that would preclude [its (PRP$)| the Senate (NNP)] backing down 
[He (PRP)| Robert Bork (NNP)] relishes what free time [he (PRP)| Robert Bork (NNP)] has 
[He (PRP)| Robert Bork (NNP)] is catching up on reading [he (PRP)| Robert Bork (NNP)] is not had a chance to do , making up for longtime neglect : Flexner's four volumes on Washington , English philosopher John Stuart Mill and [his (PRP$)| Robert Bork (NNP)] critics 
[He (PRP)| Robert Bork (NNP)] and [his (PRP$)| Robert Bork (NNP)] wife , Mary Ellen , eschew most commercial television programs and rent videotapes instead 
Popular culture as far as [I (PRP)| Robert Bork (NNP)] am concerned has gone straight downhill , Bork says 
During the hearings , Bork was astonished to learn that a radio reporter had gone to the video store [he (PRP)| a radio reporter (NN)] frequents and obtained a list of all of the tapes [he (PRP)| a radio reporter (NN)] had rented 
[I (PRP)| Robert Bork (NNP)] guess [he (PRP)| a radio reporter (NN)] was hoping for something really scandalous , but all [he (PRP)| a radio reporter (NN)] got was Fred Astaire and Cary Grant 
There is now a law against giving out such lists 
At his bedside table are mysteries , [his (PRP$)| Robert Bork (NNP)] other pastime , Martha Grimes , Dorothy Sayers , John Dickson Carr , Margery Allingham 
But [it (PRP)| his bedside table (NN)] is hard to follow a story when you read only four pages a night , [he (PRP)| Robert Bork (NNP)] says 
The sedentary life has taken [its (PRP$)| The sedentary life (NN)] toll 
Asked what his ideal weight would be , [he (PRP)| Robert Bork (NNP)] smiles and offers an understatement , less than [it (PRP)| his ideal weight (NN)] is now 
[I (PRP)| Robert Bork (NNP)] have to get [myself (PRP)| Robert Bork (NNP)] back in shape so [I (PRP)| Robert Bork (NNP)] can get back to tennis 
[I (PRP)| Robert Bork (NNP)] used to like to ski but [I (PRP)| Robert Bork (NNP)] would not dare now 
[He (PRP)| Robert Bork (NNP)] went skiing once when [he (PRP)| Robert Bork (NNP)] was out of shape 
[He (PRP)| Robert Bork (NNP)] was halfway down the slope , [he (PRP)| Robert Bork (NNP)] says , when the muscles began to flutter and that is not very good because you have to get down the rest of the mountain 
Bork enjoys the atmosphere at the American Enterprise Institute , the conservative think tank that has become [his (PRP$)| Robert Bork (NNP)] small university 
[His (PRP$)| Robert Bork (NNP)] colleagues include Irving Kristol , publisher of The National Interest , former U.N. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick , former State Department arms negotiator Richard Perle and political , economic and social commentators such as Ben Wattenberg , Michael Novak , Norman Ornstein and Walter Berns 
The institute does not make grave demands on [its (PRP$)| the American Enterprise Institute (NNP)] members 
There is an occasional brown-bag lunch where a speaker is brought in from the outside 
Bork , who abhored grading papers when [he (PRP)| Robert Bork (NNP)] taught , says with a self-satisfied grin , [It (PRP)| an occasional brown-bag lunch where a speaker is brought in from the outside (NN)] is a very good faculty , with no blue books 
The faculty often gets together for dinner 
But , one suggests , given that many active minds around the dinner table , the soup must get cold 
Not mine , says Bork
