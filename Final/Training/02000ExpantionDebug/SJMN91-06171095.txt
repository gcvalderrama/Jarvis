; [He (PRP)| John Sununu (NNP)] added , however : [It (PRP)| an appearance problem (NN)] does not set a precedent 
[It (PRP)| an appearance problem (NN)] does not say anyone that has access to a car can go anyplace that anyone wants at any time 
; [I (PRP)| anyone that has access to a car can go anyplace that anyone wants at any time (NN)] recognize , and [I (PRP)| anyone that has access to a car can go anyplace that anyone wants at any time (NN)] think the governor does , there is an appearance problem , Bush said. ; But , he added , The facts surrounding this particular trip , this beating that [he (PRP)| President Bush (NNP)] is taken , is unwarranted in [my (PRP$)| anyone that has access to a car can go anyplace that anyone wants at any time (NN)] view

White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Tuesday that direct solicitation of firms to provide such planes would not be improper , although Sununu aides deny that [he (PRP)| John Sununu (NNP)] asked directly for the planes. ; The car controversy has created new ripples among Republicans who question whether Sununu recognizes that repeated questions about his ethics reflect poorly on Bush , who vowed during [his (PRP$)| John Sununu (NNP)] campaign to bring a higher ethical standard to [his (PRP$)| John Sununu (NNP)] administration and fight even the appearance of impropriety among aides. ; One administration source , echoing comments by many Republicans outside the administration , said Tuesday that Sununu has a total blind spot on the issue of ethics and public service
