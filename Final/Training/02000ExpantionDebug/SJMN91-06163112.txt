Mount Pinatubo , the Philippine volcano that erupted Saturday after six centuries of quiet , is likely to explode in the next few days or weeks with force comparable to the Mount St. Helens explosion , a U.S. government scientist said Monday. ; [I (PRP)| a U.S. government scientist (NN)] think we could see a major explosive eruption any time , said Peter Lipman , a volcanologist at the U.S. Geological Survey office in Menlo Park 
Lipman is in daily contact with five USGS scientists in the Philippines who have been studying the volcano since April , when [it (PRP)| the volcano (NN)] first stirred 
A huge cloud of ash-laden steam rose up to 11,500 feet above the volcano today , spreading ash over a six-mile radius , the Philippine Institute of Vulcanology and Seismology said. ; If [it (PRP)| A huge cloud of ash-laden steam (NN)] does erupt , the deadly hot ash produced by the volcano could sweep across adjoining Clark Air Base , [he (PRP)| Peter Lipman (NNP)] said 
Also in peril are the 350,000 residents of Angeles City , where the air base is located , about 50 miles north of Manila. ; Even if the volcano does not erupt , the threat of eruption is likely to keep the base closed for weeks at least , Lipman said. ; Scientists doubt [it (PRP)| in peril (NN)] is more than coincidence that the eruption is occurring at the same time as the Mount Unzen volcano in Japan , [he (PRP)| Peter Lipman (NNP)] said. ; The five USGS scientists are among the few remaining people at Clark Air Base , which was evacuated along with thousands of Filipinos living near the volcano. ; The researchers , along with 10 Filipino scientists and [their (PRP$)| The researchers (NNS)] equipment , today moved to a bunker on the east edge of the air base , 12 miles from the volcano , where [they (PRP)| The researchers (NNS)] should be safe from ash avalanches. ; Mount Pinatubo is typical of hundreds of volcanoes that make up the Ring of Fire on the Pacific coasts of Asia and the Americas 
(These volcanoes including Mount Lassen in Shasta County , and Mount Rainier and Mount St. Helens in Washington , all in the Cascade Range arise where one of the earth's immense crust plates is slowly diving beneath another )
; Pinatubo's last eruption , 600 years ago , is thought to have yielded at least as much molten rock half a cubic kilometer as Mount St. Helens did when [it (PRP)| Mount St. Helens (NNP)] erupted in 1980 
Until volcanologistsattention was drawn to [it (PRP)| volcanologistsattention (NN)] by a cluster of earthquakes beneath the volcano this spring , [it (PRP)| volcanologistsattention (NN)] had not been studied well. ; Other recent volcanoes that erupted on the same scale were El Chichon in Mexico in 1983 and Nevado del Ruiz in Colombia in 1985. ; If [it (PRP)| volcanologistsattention (NN)] does have a massive eruption , Pinatubo's primary means of causing death and destruction would be hellish avalanches of hot ash 1,000 degrees or more , flowing and billowing at up to 100 mph , engulfing and searing all in [their (PRP$)| volcanologists(NNS)] path. ; In the worst case , a really big eruption , all of Clark Air Force Base could be covered with glowing ash , Lipman said. ; Just being caught in a cloud of ash blowing off the avalanche is fatal 
That is what killed 38 people in Japan last week. ; Such ash also would wreak havoc with the engines of planes at the air base , Lipman said. ; Planes flying through clouds of volcanic ash indistinguishable on radar from rain clouds run the risk of having [their (PRP$)| 38 people (NNS)] engines stalled by the grit. ; So far , the winds have blown ash away from the base 
But winds of the summer monsoon weather pattern , expected to begin any day , would send ash directly toward the base. ; The volcano's activity measured by seismometers detecting slight earthquakes in its molten rock plumbing system is increasing in a way that suggests a large eruption is imminent , Lipman said. ; The scientists also are monitoring tiltmeters on the volcano's slopes , to watch [it (PRP)| the volcano (NN)] swell as magma builds inside 
On clear days [they (PRP)| The scientists (NNS)] fly above the crater to measure sulfur emissions. ; [Their (PRP$)| The scientists (NNS)] predictions might be a false alarm the volcano may have done [its (PRP$)| the volcano (NN)] worst already 
But [it (PRP)| clear days (NNS)] would take several weeks of declining quakes and sulfur emissions before scientists would be reasonably confident that the military could return to the base. ; Volcanologists know of no reason the volcano's activity could be linked to the volcano in Japan , which is of comparable size. ; No reputable scientist [I (PRP)| the base. (NN)] know of is drawing a connection between the two , Lipman said. ; More than 500 volcanoes have erupted in historical time , [he (PRP)| the base. (NN)] noted 
Two out of 500 is no big deal
