Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas went before the Senate Judiciary Committee today , and leading Democrats said they would use his confirmation hearings to question whether [he (PRP)| Democrats (NNPS)] favors a radical change in American law including a ban on abortions. ; Thomas sat quietly in a packed committee room , [his (PRP$)| Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas (NNP)] family nearby , as Sen. Joseph Biden pledged open and fair hearings 
But Biden , D-Del. , wasted little time in getting to a topic expected to consume much of the hearings Thomasbelief in natural law , a legal theory that some individual rights are inherent and independent of all government authority 
Sen. Strom Thurmond , the panel's senior Republican , said Thomasrulings as an appeals court judge were within the mainstream and warned his Democratic colleagues about inappropriate questions. ; Requiring a nominee to pass an ideological litmus test would seriously jeopardize the efficacy and independence of the federal judiciary , Thurmond said. ; But Sen. Herb Kohl , D-Wis. , told Thomas , [We (PRP)| his Democratic colleagues (NNS)] will want to know what you really think ... Do not hide behind the argument that you ca not discuss the issues 
; Thus was the stage set for what is expected to be a lively set of hearings for Thomas , a black conservative nominated to replace retiring Justice Thurgood Marshall , the nation's first black justice. ; After each of the committee members gave an opening statement , the proceedings were stopped for a 90-minute lunch break 
Thomas was to begin [his (PRP$)| Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas (NNP)] testifying later in the afternoon. ; Even before Biden rapped the opening gavel , Thomasnomination triggered a confirmation battle more akin to a political campaign television commercials , endorsements by dozens of groups for and against , and a daily drumbeat of support from President Bush. ; Abortion aside , Thomas also is expected to be questioned about his views on civil rights especially affirmative action and the right of privacy. ; Thomas smiled broadly as [he (PRP)| Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas (NNP)] shook hands with Biden and other members of the committee in advance of the opening gavel. ; Moment of humor ; For the most part , [he (PRP)| Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas (NNP)] sat quietly at the witness table while members of the committee outlined [their (PRP$)| other members of the committee in advance of the opening gavel. ; Moment of humor (NNS)] views on his nomination. ; There was a moment of humor when Biden asked Thomas how old [he (PRP)| Sen. Joseph Biden (NNP)] was 
Thomas , 43 , replied , well , [I (PRP)| Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas (NNP)] have aged over the last 10 weeks since [his (PRP$)| Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas (NNP)] nomination. ; Sen. Edward M. Kennedy , D-Mass. , said that while Thomas has never commented publicly on abortion directly , the nominee once praised a speech that called abortion the constitutional equivalent of murder 
; But Sen. Orrin Hatch , R-Utah , a strong Thomas supporter , said Thomas should not be forced to spell out [his (PRP$)| Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas (NNP)] views on abortion because Justice David H. Souter , who won Senate confirmation last year , was not required to do so. ; Questioned on natural law ; Biden said Thomas would be asked about [his (PRP$)| Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas (NNP)] belief in natural law 
Some critics contend Thomas holds natural-law views that could lead to the conclusion that fetuses have a right to life requiring states to outlaw all abortions. ; Biden [himself (PRP)| Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas (NNP)] is an advocate of natural law in some form , but [he (PRP)| Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas (NNP)] said Thomas apparently holds a vision of natural law that [we (PRP)| dozens of groups (NNS)] have moved beyond 
; Biden said [he (PRP)| Sen. Joseph Biden (NNP)] would be looking closely to see whether Thomasphilosophy would lead to imposition of a moral code on the Constitution and radical change in legal opinion. ; Thurmond , of South Carolina , said Thomas has all [it (PRP)| South Carolina (NNP)] takes to become an outstanding member of the Supreme Court 
; It is not appropriate that philosophy alone should bar a nominee from the Supreme Court unless that nominee holds a belief that is contrary to the fundamental , longstanding principles of [our (PRP$)| Some critics (NNS)] nation , Thurmond said in prepared comments. ; In prepared opening remarks that reflected Democratsambiguity about Thomas , Sen. Patrick V. Leahy , D-Vt. , said , [I (PRP)| Strom Thurmond (NNP)] am impressed and the country is by the less-traveled road you have taken from Pinpoint , Ga. , to the threshold of the Supreme Court 
Your self-discipline , diligence and hard work are exemplary. ; But at the same time , your record and your writings trouble [me (PRP)| your record (NN)] , Leahy said 
[I (PRP)| your record (NN)] have no clear idea of your approach to the Constitution 
; [I (PRP)| the White House (NNP)] am also troubled by your open admiration for those who are willing to deceive and defy Congress and by the hostility [you (PRP)| your record (NN)] have demonstrated toward Congress both in action and in word , Leahy said. ; As the hearings opened , the White House expressed confidence today that the Senate would confirm Thomas. ; [It (PRP)| the Senate Judiciary Committee (NNP)] is just beginning up there ; [it (PRP)| the Senate Judiciary Committee (NNP)] is just beginning , Bush said when asked if Thomasconfirmation was assured. ; People know of [my (PRP$)| the White House (NNP)] total support for [him (PRP)| Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas (NNP)] and [I (PRP)| the White House (NNP)] think [he (PRP)| Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas (NNP)] will do very well 
But now [it (PRP)| your open admiration (NN)] is in the hands of the Senate 
Let them make this determination , Bush said. ; Independence of the court ; Making a fresh appeal for Thomas on the eve of today's opening hearing , Bush exhorted lawmakers Monday to preserve the independence of the court by avoiding asking the nominee how he would vote. ; But one member of the committee , Sen. Howard Metzenbaum , D-Ohio , said on NBC-TV today : I think we have a right to find out from him exactly what is going through his head on a number of issues 
And [I (PRP)| Sen. Howard Metzenbaum , D-Ohio (NNP)] think to do less than that would be irresponsible on our part 
; White House spokesman Judy Smith said today that , although the White House would not divulge numbers in an informal head count , We are confident Judge Thomas will be confirmed 
; If confirmed , Thomas would be the 106th Supreme Court justice but only the second black. ; The committee is expected to closely examine Thomasrecord as chairman of the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and as head of the Education Department's civil rights office 
Liberals contend [he (PRP)| Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas (NNP)] pursued policies that slowed , or even blocked , increased opportunities for minorities and women. ; Feminist groups have been in the forefront of the liberal coalition opposing Thomas , warning that [his (PRP$)| Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas (NNP)] vote added to an already conservative Supreme Court could overturn federal protection for abortion rights and send the issue back to state legislatures
