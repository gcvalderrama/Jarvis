THE SHARP deterioration in relations between Britain and China over Hong Kong's political future has cast a pall over the colony's financial markets 
The territory's stock market opened this morning sharply lower 
After half an hour of trading the Hang Seng index was hovering just above 6,000 , down more than 245 points , continuing Friday's weaker trend 
Analysts had expected a decline in the market , which had recently risen strongly in response to the economic policies announced by China's communist leaders 
Relations between the UK and China have deteriorated markedly since Mr Patten , with the general support of the Hong Kong people , announced proposals on October 7 for elections in 1994 and 1995 which would allow for greater , though still limited , democracy in choosing local leaders 
Since then , the governor has repeatedly held out the possibility that he will proceed with his plans even in the face of opposition from China - marking a change in British policy towards Hong Kong and China 
In the past London has placed a priority on reaching agreement with Beijing 
Such a head-to-head contest between Beijing and Britain's governor in Hong Kong would be without precedent in the colony 
[It (PRP)| Such a head-to-head contest between Beijing (NN)] would require from the people of Hong Kong a defiance of Beijing which many of their business and political leaders have been reluctant to make for fear of damaging their interests 
Mr Patten presented [his (PRP$)| Mr Patten (NNP)] plans to officials in Beijing on a three-day visit last week and told [them (PRP)| officials in Beijing (NNS)] [he (PRP)| Mr Patten (NNP)] needed a decision by the end of the year 
His proposals were flatly rejected 
On Friday , Lu Ping , China's top official on Hong Kong affairs , said Beijing would challenge the validity of future elections and abrogate agreements to build the colony's multi-billion dollar airport if Mr Patten proceeded without China's agreement 
The airport and [its (PRP$)| the colony's multi-billion dollar airport (NN)] associated infrastructure projects have been a running sore in Anglo-Chinese relations since the project was announced , in the aftermath of the June 1989 uprising in Beijing , as a confidence boosting measure for the colony 
Agreement to proceed with the HKDollars 163.5 bn project was only reached a year ago when Mr John Major , Britain's prime minister , visited Beijing 
Since then China has found fault with two alternative financing proposals put to [it (PRP)| China (NNP)] by the Hong Kong government 
[It (PRP)| China (NNP)] claims that both are not cost-effective and would put an onerous financial burden on the post-1997 government in Hong Kong - charges which find little support in Hong Kong's financial community 
The government had already let 17 contracts worth HKDollars 19bn - HKDollars 3bn under budget 
Mr Patten has said the government would do [its (PRP$)| the post-1997 government (NN)] best to complete the project in the absence of the Chinese government's approval 
But Lu's threat , calculated to scare the international financial community , could make [it (PRP)| Lu's threat (NN)] difficult for the government to raise external finance to fund the project 
Lu held out little hope of agreement on either constitutional or airport related matters 
He claimed the governor's plans violated the 1984 Anglo-British Joint Declaration on Hong Kong and the Basic Law , which will act as Hong Kong's post-1997 constitution 
He also asserted Mr Patten's plans ignored assurances given by Mr Douglas Hurd , Britain's foreign secretary , to Qian Qichen , [his (PRP$)| Mr Patten (NNP)] Chinese counterpart , on the conduct of the 1995 polls 
In a robust performance before a special session of the Legislative Council (LegCo )on Saturday , Mr Patten reissued [his (PRP$)| Mr Patten (NNP)] challenge to Beijing to respond with constructive alternatives to proposals [he (PRP)| Mr Patten (NNP)] made on October 7 for the colony's political development 
The governor said [he (PRP)| the governor (NN)] was prepared to discuss these alternatives with China but reminded legislators that any alternatives had to be fair , open and command the support of the people of Hong Kong 
[They (PRP)| these legislators (NNS)] also had to be agreed soon as legislation would have to be placed before LegCo early in the New Year 
During the special sitting of LegCo , Mr Patten proposals were endorsed by liberal politicians and some independents 
Conservative politicians did not declare [their (PRP$)| Conservative politicians (NNS)] position 
Some of the colony's newspapers also expressed concern about China's reaction to the governor's proposals 
With an eye on these legislators , the governor reminded all members of LegCo that it is [they who will have to pass any legislation drawn up to provide for the forthcoming elections (PRP)| these legislators (NNS)] 
We should all be clear on where we stand , [he (PRP)| the governor (NN)] said 
Nothing can absolve members of this council from taking a view on the future political development of Hong Kong 
The proposals , which Mr Patten believes are consistent with Anglo-Chinese agreements and Chinese law , provide for a greater , though still restricted , application of democracy in the conduct of future elections 
Mr Patten denied that the UK had given China the undertakings Lu claimed 
[He (PRP)| Mr Patten (NNP)] said [he (PRP)| Mr Patten (NNP)] had no objection to letters from Mr Hurd and Qian being made public 
That decision , however , is not [his (PRP$)| Mr Patten (NNP)] 
The government is bracing [itself (PRP)| the post-1997 government (NN)] for a further onslaught on Mr Patten's plans from the colony's pro-Beijing press 
Designed to undermine [his (PRP$)| Mr Patten (NNP)] public support , these newspapers published more than 70 attacks on [him (PRP)| Mr Patten (NNP)] and [his (PRP$)| Mr Patten (NNP)] plans in the lead up to [his (PRP$)| Mr Patten (NNP)] visit to Beijing 
As China's attitude to the airport shows , it is prepared to sacrifice the economic well-being of its people in response to a perceived threat to [its (PRP$)| the economic well-being of its people in response (NN)] political authority 
Mr Patten , says his aides , knows this and does not plan to stand still 
According to aides , the governor believes [he (PRP)| the governor (NN)] can carry the legislature ; in the event of failure to find agreement with China , [they (PRP)| his aides (NNS)] promise a publicity campaign of the sort which prepared the colony for [his (PRP$)| the governor (NN)] policy speech 
We will not be neutral , said one 
Mr Patten has said , however , that what [he (PRP)| Mr Patten (NNP)] finally proposes has to be acceptable to the people of Hong Kong
This condition allows [him (PRP)| Mr Patten (NNP)] to change [his (PRP$)| Mr Patten (NNP)] policies in line with [his (PRP$)| Mr Patten (NNP)] reading of public opinion and the reality in LegCo 
As another of his aides , speaking of the choices the Hong Kong people now face , noted : [It (PRP)| the international financial community (NN)] is their community after all
