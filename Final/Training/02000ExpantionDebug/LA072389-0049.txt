Southern California's favorite gambling town is on a roll 
Spurred by strong increases in tourism and convention business , Las Vegas hotel construction is booming as never before 
Between now and 1992 , more than 20,000 hotel rooms will be added to the 61,000 existing rooms , hotel owners and industry analysts say , and about 7,000 of those will be in two hotels 
One is the $ 630-million Mirage , being built by Golden Nugget Inc. , which will have 3,100 rooms when it opens Dec. 1 
The other is the $ 290-million Excalibur , a project of Circus Circus Enterprises 
It will have 4,032 rooms , the most of any hotel in the country when it opens in June 
Las Vegas is experiencing the greatest growth phase of [its (PRP$)| downtown Las Vegas (NNP)] history , said Saul F. Leonard , a gaming industries expert with Laventhol & Horwath , Los Angeles 
The Mirage and Excalibur will be the first new major projects in the city in 15 years , and with [their (PRP$)| must-sees (NNS)] unusual features , [they (PRP)| must-sees (NNS)] will be must-sees 
The president of The Mirage , Bobby Baldwin , said most of [his (PRP$)| The president of The Mirage , Bobby Baldwin (NN)] hotel's features were a secret of sorts , but earlier reports indicate that it will have a $ 9-million lagoon , a 49-foot waterfall and a 100-foot-high , sky-lit atrium filled with 70-foot-high banyan trees , coconut palms and tropical orchids 
Excalibur will feature a medieval theme , with a moving walkway that will carry visitors over a moat and through castle gates to a casino , an amphitheater , shops and restaurants 
Both the Mirage and Excalibur are being built on The Strip 
But Fletch Brunelle , research coordinator for the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority , said that there are hotel construction projects under way all over the city 
[He (PRP)| Fletch Brunelle (NNP)] estimated that about 11,500 hotel rooms are being built , and 38,000 more are proposed , some of which will be completed after the 20,000 planned to be available by 1992 
Many of the new rooms are being added to existing hotels , which are also expanding their casinos and convention halls , Leonard added 
The construction boom was created , experts say , by an aggressive marketing strategy used in the past few years by the state , the city's Convention Authority and the major hotels to capture conventions , trade shows and group tours 
Strategy Is Working The strategy is apparently working 
Las Vegas is the third largest convention city in the United States and probably will be No. 2 within the next two years , Leonard said 
(Experts agree that New York is No. 1 , but [they (PRP)| experts (NNS)] are split , between Chicago and Atlanta as to which city is No. 2 )
Nevada , especially Las Vegas , is already one of the top destinations for group tours coming from Asia , said Rich Moreno , state director of tourism 
Since an office to stimulate Japanese travel to Nevada was established in Tokyo three years ago , the number of Japanese tourists visiting the state jumped from 165,000 to 300,000 , [he (PRP)| Rich Moreno (NNP)] added 
And [he (PRP)| Rich Moreno (NNP)] expects the number of all Asian visitors to grow after a Taipei office is opened in a few months 
Tours from Europe The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority hopes to make the city a top destination for tours from Europe as well 
[It (PRP)| Europe The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority (NNP)] is in our budget to help fund an office in London or Frankfurt , said Frank Sain , the bureau's executive director 
The bureau's advertising budget for the next fiscal year is about $ 10 million , and that will be spent on ads in newspapers , magazines , billboards , and TV and radio 
Southern California is our primary market , Sain said , estimating that Californians represent up to 42 % of all Las Vegas visitors , which jumped from 11.7 million to 17.2 million in the past 10 years 
About two-thirds of the California visitors come from Southern California , said Maurice Robinson , a senior manager with KPMG Peat Marwick , Los Angeles 
The proximity of Southern California to Las Vegas undoubtedly contributes to the fact that the growth in Nevada , in terms of casino revenues and visitors , is overwhelmingly in Clark County , said Andy Grose , executive director of the state's Economic Development Commission 
([It (PRP)| a statewide phenomenon (NN)] )is not a statewide phenomenon 
Laughlin a Boom Town If [you (PRP)| Andy Grose , executive director of the state's Economic Development Commission (NNP)] really want to see a boom town , though , [you (PRP)| Andy Grose , executive director of the state's Economic Development Commission (NNP)] should go to Laughlin , Leonard said 
Laughlin , also in Clark County but a little closer than Las Vegas to Los Angeles , had 430 hotel rooms in 1981 but slightly more than 4,000 at the end of 1988 , [he (PRP)| Laughlin (NNP)] noted , and it is expected to have about 13,000 at the end of 1991 
Laughlin drew some business from downtown Las Vegas , [he (PRP)| Laughlin (NNP)] said , but owners of the downtown Las Vegas hotels and casinos have changed their marketing strategy to capture richer customers 
[They (PRP)| owners of the downtown Las Vegas hotels and casinos (NNS)] switched , said Jim Needham of Arthur Young in Seattle , from courting blue-collar workers and moms and pops carrying around milkshake containers of nickels to younger people looking for a one-stop place for a show , gambling and resort 
Seeking Conventions Hotel/casino owners throughout Las Vegas responded the same way to business setbacks in 1979 , when casinos first opened in Atlantic City , N.J. , and in the early 80s , when there was an economic recession 
[They (PRP)| Hotel/casino owners (NNS)] changed [their (PRP$)| Hotel/casino owners (NNS)] marketing strategy by seeking conventions and those visitors who would stay longer than a day 
Las Vegas saw what [it (PRP)| downtown Las Vegas (NNP)] had to do , said Dave Daley , a partner in the Arthur Andersen Real Estate Services Group 
Las Vegas turned from a weekend regional , getaway place where people would drive to go , to a national convention place competitive with such cities as San Francisco , Chicago and Los Angeles , said Robinson of KPMG Peat Marwick 
Most of Atlantic City's 30 million annual visitors do not stay overnight , observed Sean Hennessey , a vice president of Landauer Associates , New York 
Pull from the Midwest And [I (PRP)| Sean Hennessey (NNP)] would say that Las Vegas still enjoys a tremendous pull from the Midwestern states and even from Buffalo and areas approximate to Atlantic City , which is still trying to get better airport and convention facilities to emulate Las Vegas 
But Las Vegas is still improving [its (PRP$)| downtown Las Vegas (NNP)] airport and convention facilities 
Although the first of a three-phased , $ 1-billion expansion of McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas was completed a few years ago , the second phase is under way , and the city has just launched a $ 35-million expansion of [its (PRP$)| the city in 15 years (NN)] convention center 
Many hotels are also adding convention accommodations , including the Sands , where a 1-million-square-foot convention center , touted as the largest outside a facility operated by a community , is expected to be completed in 17 months 
New sites are also coming up for future gaming , convention and hotel development 
The largest in the city is a 300-acre site owned by the Union Pacific Railroad , which is being marketed by Cushman Realty , Los Angeles 
[It (PRP)| a 300-acre site owned by the Union Pacific Railroad , which is being marketed by Cushman Realty , Los Angeles (NN)] is all part of the city's drive to stay on top of the competition , including state lotteries , which , gaming experts say , have helped the casinos at the same time 
Lotteries have made gaming more acceptable , a mainstream activity , said Landauer's Hennessey 
New Experiences Planned But Las Vegas is banking on more than [its (PRP$)| downtown Las Vegas (NNP)] current gaming and convention capabilities to draw visitors and fill hotel rooms 
New games and experiences and a proposed train are in the cards 
Said John O'Reilly , chairman of the Nevada Gaming Commission : [I (PRP)| Sean Hennessey , a vice president of Landauer Associates (NNP)] think that in the next 12 to 24 months , there will be some new games with more universal appeal than most games of the past 
Las Vegas is also betting on what state tourism director Moreno describes as new experiences , like the live dolphins that will perform at the Mirage and jousting tournaments that will be held at Excalibur 
People wo not just go to a hotel as a place to stay but as an experience , [he (PRP)| state tourism director Moreno (NNP)] said 
Las Vegas is also betting on a super-speed train , which would make the trip from downtown Las Vegas to downtown Los Angeles in an hour for $ 65 , round trip 
[I (PRP)| Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar ), chairman of the 16-member California-Nevada Super Speed Ground Transportation Committee (NNP)] want [it (PRP)| downtown Las Vegas (NNP)] to happen , said Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar ), chairman of the 16-member California-Nevada Super Speed Ground Transportation Committee 
[We (PRP)| younger people looking for a one-stop place for a show , gambling and resort (NNS)] will know in a year if [it (PRP)| a year (NN)] is financially and environmentally possible 
The train would be privately funded at a cost of $ 3.5 billion , [he (PRP)| Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar ), chairman of the 16-member California-Nevada Super Speed Ground Transportation Committee (NNP)] added 
The Race is On Despite the price , Arnie Adamsen , a Las Vegas city councilman and vice chairman of the commission , said , [It (PRP)| the price (NN)] could conceivably start construction in 1993 and be on line from 1996 to 1998 
In the meantime , the race is on to see which hotel will have the most rooms to attract the largest conventions 
For some time , the 3,174-room Las Vegas Hilton has been billed as the largest hotel in the free world 
[It (PRP)| some time (NN)] will be overshadowed by the Flamingo Hilton after a 750-room expansion there brings the Flamingo's room count to 3,650 in early 1990 , but Excalibur will be the biggest when [it (PRP)| Excalibur (NNP)] opens in June , 1990 
A 1,700-room , 42-story tower , which is being called the tallest in the state , is expected to bring the Riviera Hotel's room count to about 4,000 in late 1991 or 1992 
And a 1,500-room tower to be completed in 20 months at the Sands will bring that hotel's room total to nearly 3,000 
The number of rooms under construction is a lot in a short period of time , experts agree , but most are optimistic that occupancy rates will remain high after a slight downturn 
A glut of hotel rooms will exist , said Leonard , but only temporarily 
Occupancy Rates 85 % Current occupancy rates are in the 85 % range in Las Vegas , while occupancies range between 65 % and 70 % for hotels in the rest of the country , according to Hennessey 
What is dropping is motel occupancy , said Sain , of the Convention Authority 
It is still at a respectable 73 % , [he (PRP)| Frank Sain (NNP)] noted , but they are not getting the hotel overflow 
In the eight years [I (PRP)| Frank Sain (NNP)] have been here , not that many new motels have been built because most convention and trade show people want hotels with all [their (PRP$)| younger people looking for a one-stop place for a show , gambling and resort (NNS)] amenities 
In the long-range , predicted Leonard , Las Vegas will continue to grow because there is so much happening there 
And when you consider that only about 10 % of the people in the United States have ever been to Las Vegas , you know that the city has a hell of a long way to grow
