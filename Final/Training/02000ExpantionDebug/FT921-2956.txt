LAST FRIDAY was the day of the annual agricultural show at Prieska in the northern part of South Africa's Cape Province 
A few score farmers and [their (PRP$)| A few score farmers (NNS)] families from a radius of a about 100 km (62 miles )had gathered to wander around about a dozen trade and craft stands , have a braai (barbecue )lunch and to see which of [them (PRP)| A few score farmers (NNS)] would be awarded the prize for the best Fat-Tailed Persian sheep 
The temperature was in the mid-40s centigrade (about 120 deg F )
This is virtually desert country where a farmer needs several thousand hectares and a drought - and heat-resistant breed of sheep to make a reasonable living 
It lies between the Great Karoo in the south and the Kalahari in the north and the town owes [its (PRP$)| the Kalahari in the north and the town (NNP)] existence and past wealth to the mining of blue asbestos and copper from the nearby hills 
Now the copper mine is worked out and the lung disease asbestosis has killed the demand for the asbestos the area once produced 
Today Prieska relies almost entirely on agriculture and in both prosperity and population it is only half the town [it (PRP)| Prieska (NNP)] once was 
But the mood at the show was jovial and relaxed 
The quality of the sheep entered for the competition was excellent , the food was good and the local MP was among the small crowd 
They know [him (PRP)| South Africa's minister of agriculture (NN)] well ; for not only is [he a neighbouring farmer (PRP)| South Africa's minister of agriculture (NN)] ([his (PRP$)| South Africa's minister of agriculture (NN)] farm is just 170 km away by dirt road and that qualifies as neighbour in this vast hot countryside )but [he (PRP)| South Africa's minister of agriculture (NN)] is also South Africa's minister of agriculture 
Mr Kraai van Niekerk would probably have attended the show as a farmer in any case but last week [he (PRP)| Mr Kraai van Niekerk (NNP)] was campaigning for today's referendum on continued political reform in South Africa , and Prieska is the centre of [his (PRP$)| Mr Kraai van Niekerk (NNP)] constituency 
[He (PRP)| Mr Kraai van Niekerk (NNP)] had delivered a speech at another town that morning ; now [he (PRP)| Mr Kraai van Niekerk (NNP)] was pressing the flesh of [his (PRP$)| Mr Kraai van Niekerk (NNP)] fellow farmers before addressing a house meeting in the late afternoon and another in the local town hall in the evening 
In the sweltering heat [it (PRP)| the sweltering heat (NN)] was a punishing schedule 
If the voters reject continued reform Mr van Niekerk , along with the rest of the cabinet , will begin preparations to resign 
But if the majority of South Africa's white electorate votes against calls by the Conservative Party and the AWB for a return to old ways , the minister will be able to return to other pressing problems in his department 
Chief among these is the extended drought which has affected a significant proportion of the Republic 
Indeed , I had expected that the arid area in which the minister's own farm is situated would be suffering most 
But I was wrong 
When I went with [him (PRP)| South Africa's minister of agriculture (NN)] to [his (PRP$)| South Africa's minister of agriculture (NN)] 13,000-hectare holding , which has an annual rainfall of just 6 inches and where temperatures in the high 30s and low 40s centigrade are normal throughout the long summer , [he (PRP)| South Africa's minister of agriculture (NN)] explained that the secret of success on such dry bush veldt was to restrict stocking rates ([he (PRP)| South Africa's minister of agriculture (NN)] runs only one Merino wool sheep per 10 hectares )and to conserve what little moisture was available 
This meant moving each 300-head flock on a regular basis from one 100-hectare camp (pasture )to another so as not to destroy the indigenous grasses and bushes sprouting from the sandy , rocky terrain and which , incredibly to my unaccustomed eye , sustained the animals in good condition 
He talked with enthusiasm and detailed knowledge about the balance of nature 
And he claimed that it was not farmers like him , who were used to managing in dry weather , who were in financial trouble 
[It (PRP)| the balance of nature (NN)] is , in fact , the arable farmers further east who are suffering most , as I had seen and heard for myself a few days earlier , and Mr van Niekerk has already set up committees of bankers , extension officers and local farmersrepresentatives , to try to find ways to avoid many of [them (PRP)| committees of bankers , extension officers and local farmersrepresentatives (NNS)] going bankrupt 
Aid schemes are being worked out , wherever possible , to write off some debt and to re-schedule the rest , often at subsidised interest rates 
But in many cases the financial position is such that the farmer is beyond help 
Critics of the rescue attempts allege that most of the farmers who are in trouble are financially illiterate and that [they (PRP)| Critics of the rescue (NNS)] are reaping the results of unbridled expenditure and expansion in the boom years of the 1970s and 1980s 
Mr van Niekerk concedes that such suggestions contain an element of truth But the drought is also an established fact and there are socio-economic as well as agricultural reasons why as many farmers as possible should be saved 
To allow vast numbers of farms to go out of business at a time when there is little enthusiasm , even among successful farmers for expansion , would put tens of thousands of black farm labourers out of work 
Since the repeal of the Group Areas Act two years ago there has already been enormous growth in the squatter camps around big towns 
Hordes of unemployed farm workers would add to an already serious problem 
There is also the immediate problem of ensuring the availability of sufficient food 
South Africa consumes between 6m and 7m tonnes of maize each year 
Production from this year's drought stricken crops is forecast at less than 3m tonnes 
In addition , the republic has long term commitments to supply maize to other southern African countries 
It appears likely , therefore , that it will be necessary for South Africa to import up to 5m tonnes of maize during the coming months 
Some commentators have suggested that the port facilities are inadequate to handle such volumes within the time available but Mr van Niekerk assured me that [his (PRP$)| Mr Kraai van Niekerk (NNP)] department had done the calculations and confirmed that [they (PRP)| Some commentators (NNS)] can and that imports have already begun to arrive 
[He (PRP)| Mr Kraai van Niekerk (NNP)] also denied that there was any possibility of rationing over coming months 
Some of [his (PRP$)| Mr Kraai van Niekerk (NNP)] optimism was based , however , on the possibility that South African-grown wheat could be substituted for maize when [it (PRP)| South African-grown wheat (NN)] was harvested in November 
But back in the Orange Free State , last week , farmers were worrying about the continued absence of any rain to provide moisture to germinate wheat seeds when [they (PRP)| successful farmers for expansion (NNS)] were due to be planted in a few weeks time 
Theirs is a summer rainfall area and that season is almost over 
If [they (PRP)| successful farmers for expansion (NNS)] get no rain , there will be no point sowing the seed and [they (PRP)| successful farmers for expansion (NNS)] will have no crops to harvest next November 
As the minister said , that is a long way ahead and there will be time to make arrangements to deal with that problem should [it (PRP)| a few weeks time (NN)] occur 
But in the meantime there is little doubt that the drought , the cost of aid to farmers and the planned expenditure on food imports will have figured in the South African budget calculations due to be announced tomorrow 
Whichever way you look at [it (PRP)| Whichever way (NN)] this is a crucial time for South Africa
