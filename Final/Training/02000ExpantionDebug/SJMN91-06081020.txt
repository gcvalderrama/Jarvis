Motorist Rodney King's night of terror at the hands of baton-wielding officers began with California Highway Patrol officers flagging him down and promising that [he (PRP)| Motorist Rodney King's (NNP)] would not be hurt if [he (PRP)| Motorist Rodney King's (NNP)] stopped. ; [It (PRP)| Motorist Rodney King's night of terror at the hands of baton-wielding officers (NN)] ended in the hospital March 3 with 11 broken bones in [his (PRP$)| Motorist Rodney King's (NNP)] skull , a leg fracture and other injuries suffered while being hit 56 times in a rain of baton blows and kicks 
Hundreds of confidential documents obtained by the Los Angeles Times indicate that officers who stopped the Altadena motorist played down [his (PRP$)| the Altadena motorist (NN)] injuries in [their (PRP$)| officers who stopped the Altadena motorist (NNS)] official reports. ; But Highway Patrol officers at the scene told investigators that [they (PRP)| Highway Patrol officers at the scene (NNS)] were shocked by the ferocity of the beating. ; Police have now determined that 21 Los Angeles police officers were at the scene , instead of 15 as initially reported 
There were also three Highway Patrol officers and two school police officers. ; Police officers , unaware that [they (PRP)| Police officers (NNS)] had been videotaped by an amateur video buff , said in [their (PRP$)| Police officers (NNS)] reports that King suffered cuts and bruises of a minor nature

Koon and Powell were also charged with filing a false police report. ; After the arrest , Koon wrote in [his (PRP$)| Stacey Koon (NNP)] daily report that reinforcements are needed to ensure a suspect's submission because sometimes batons and electric stun guns do not work the way [they (PRP)| Koon , Powell , Wind and Officer Ted Briseno (NNP)] are supposed to. ; Highway Patrol Officers Tim and Melanie Singer said [they (PRP)| Highway Patrol Officers Tim and Melanie Singer (NNP)] saw the first half-dozen blows inflicted on King

; The Singers , a husband-and-wife team , saw King when [he (PRP)| one Los Angeles police officer (NN)] and two passengers were driving on Interstate 210 at what Melanie Singer estimated were speeds of up to 100 mph. ; [She (PRP)| Melanie Singer estimated (NNP)] said King refused to stop , even after her husband advised [him (PRP)| her husband (NN)] over [their (PRP$)| The Singers (NNS)] car bullhorn : Pull over to the right 
[We (PRP)| The Singers , a husband-and-wife team (NNS)] wo not hurt [you (PRP)| Gabriel Aid (NNP)] 
; Los Angeles police joined the pursuit 
Melanie Singer said that , when King got out of the car , [he (PRP)| Motorist Rodney King's (NNP)] appeared jovial , dancing and heavily intoxicated 
One passenger in King's car said [they (PRP)| The Singers , a husband-and-wife team (NNS)] had been drinking malt liquor. ; As Melanie Singer approached King , she said Koon told her , No , no 
Get back 
[We (PRP)| The Singers , a husband-and-wife team (NNS)] will handle 
[She (PRP)| malt liquor. ; As Melanie Singer approached King , she said Koon told her (NN)] said Koon shot King twice with a Taser stun gun , and King stumbled to the ground. ; Officer Powell ran up and struck the suspect on the right side of [his (PRP$)| Laurence M. Powell (NNP)] head with [his (PRP$)| Laurence M. Powell (NNP)] baton , [she (PRP)| malt liquor. ; As Melanie Singer approached King , she said Koon told her (NN)] told investigators 
The suspect clasped [his (PRP$)| Stacey Koon (NNP)] hands to [his (PRP$)| Stacey Koon (NNP)] face and screamed with pain 
[He (PRP)| Stacey Koon (NNP)] was bleeding 
Powell then struck [him (PRP)| Laurence M. Powell (NNP)] five to six more times in rapid succession in the head and neck area 
; She described the blows as causing [his (PRP$)| Laurence M. Powell (NNP)] face to split 
; At that point , she said , another Los Angeles police officer grabbed Powell's arm to stop [him (PRP)| another Los Angeles police officer (NN)] , and Koon yelled at Powell , Stop ! 
Stop ! 
That is enough ! 
; Mr. King appeared to be less resistive , she recalled 
I considered [him (PRP)| Motorist Rodney King's (NNP)] disabled
