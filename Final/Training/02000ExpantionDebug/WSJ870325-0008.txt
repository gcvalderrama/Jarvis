On the day the 25-cent-an-hour minimum wage became the law of the land nearly 50 years ago , a wave of pecan-shelling and tobacco-stemming factories closed throughout the South and industries warned of economic mayhem 
Similar alarms are likely to be sounded today when Sen. Edward Kennedy (D. , Mass. )and Rep. Augustus Hawkins (D. , Calif. ), who head the Senate and House Labor committees , are expected to introduce legislation to increase the minimum wage from its current rate of $ 3.35 an hour to about $ 4.65 hourly over three years , with future automatic annual adjustments 
If the wage is boosted , warns Anne Papa , a National Restaurant Association official , employers will be forced to cut back on [their (PRP$)| employers (NNS)] work forces 
But pressure is building among Democrats in a Congress they now control to raise the wage , which was last increased six years ago 
Says Rep. Hawkins : The cost of living has gone up tremendously since the minimum wage was last raised 
The value has been eroded 
Adds Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D. , Ohio ): [We (PRP)| employers (NNS)] have not adjusted [it (PRP)| D. (NNP)] for inflation for a number of years and the issue needs [our (PRP$)| employers (NNS)] attention 
Prospects for passage look favorable 
[It (PRP)| passage look (NN)] is going to happen , predicts a Democratic House strategist 
What is less certain is the shape the bill will finally take , and whether a veto is inevitable from a president who once said the minimum wage has caused more misery and unemployment than anything else since the Great Depression 
Republicans generally contend that the way to help the low-paid is not by mandating higher pay and forcing some of them out of jobs but by expanding job training and education 
Conceived as part of the New Deal , the minimum wage was heralded at [its (PRP$)| part of the New Deal (NN)] birth as one of the most notable advances in our national effort to improve economic conditions in the United States 
But inflation has taken a toll in recent years 
Congress last voted in 1977 to increase the wage ; the last of four step-ups occurred in January 1981 when it rose 25 cents to $ 3.35 
But while the wage has remained the same , prices have climbed 28 % , according to economist Sar Levitan 
[He (PRP)| economist Sar Levitan (NNP)] asserts that the inflation-adjusted value of the minimum wage is now at the lowest level in 33 years 
The AFL-CIO calls minimum-wage workers the have-nots of America 
The labor federation has made the issue a legislative priority , arguing that an increase is long overdue 
The minimum wage simply has not kept up with rising living standards and rising median wages , adds Jeff Faux , president of the Economic Policy Institute , a liberal think tank 
Attention to the issue is heightened at a time of national focus on welfare overhaul 
If we want to support the work ethic , we have to give people a living wage , says Mr. Levitan , who directs George Washington University's Center for Social Policy Studies 
He and others concede that increases in the minimum wage do result in some job losses 
But they contend the extent is overstated , and partly offset by new jobs created by stimulated economic growth 
Moreover , an increase will eliminate a great deal of deprivation in the United States , [he (PRP)| economist Sar Levitan (NNP)] says 
[His (PRP$)| economist Sar Levitan (NNP)] research shows that income from the minimum wage was enough to raise a family of three out of poverty during most of the 1960s and 1970s 
But not anymore 
Now , someone working full-time at the minimum wage earns $ 6,968 a year , or $ 1,773 less than the 1986 poverty threshold of $ 8,741 for a family of three 
Only a worker living alone can make enough money at the basic wage to lift [himself (PRP)| someone working full-time at the minimum wage (NN)] above the poverty line 
But many business groups think the consequences of another increase will be dire 
[It (PRP)| another increase (NN)] would cost jobs ... drive up prices and decrease services , asserts Mark de Bernardo , manager of labor law for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce 
The chamber claims that 644,000 jobs were lost as a result of the last minimum-wage increase 
Employers say [they (PRP)| employers (NNS)] would have to raise wages for other workers , and costs would inevitably be passed on to the consumer 
There were 70,000 small-business failures last year , says Mr. de Bernardo 
If [we (PRP)| employers (NNS)] see a minimum-wage increase , that number is going to increase dramatically 
Small businesses in the restaurant and retail fields fear the worst damage 
Jerry Goodwin , president of Reese Coffee Houses in Denver , sees nothing but harmful effects 
The last time the minimum was raised , [he (PRP)| Jerry Goodwin (NNP)] laid off the graveyard shift at one of his seven coffee shops to cut costs 
[I (PRP)| Jerry Goodwin (NNP)] let those four people go and those four jobs have been lost forever , [he (PRP)| Jerry Goodwin (NNP)] says 
Critics argue that ripple effects affect everyone 
Higher labor costs force employers to cut corners , and service suffers 
You go in a parking lot in Denver , there is never an attendant , says Mr. Goodwin 
[I (PRP)| Jerry Goodwin (NNP)] have not seen an usher in a theater in 10 years 
Counters Rep. Hawkins : There is something wrong with a small business that needs this substandard wage to survive 
About 61 million workers in a national work force of 120 million are covered by the minimum-wage law 
[They (PRP)| 61 million workers in a national work (NNS)] are generally those who are engaged in interstate commerce or produce goods for interstate commerce 
Nearly 3.5 million hourly workers earn the minimum wage , according to the Labor Department , but it is expected that any increase would also benefit the nearly 1.5 million workers who are paid below the minimum and others who earn slightly above the minimum 
Who the minimum-wage earners are is a source of dispute 
Mr. Levitan's research shows that nearly 30 % are heads of households and about the same number are teenagers 
But the Chamber of Commerce claims [they (PRP)| households (NNS)] are mostly teens entering the work force , students working part time , or adults supplementing primary family incomes 
Thus the chamber's Mr. de Bernardo says arguments about family poverty are misleading 
[It (PRP)| the U.S. Chamber of Commerce (NNP)] is not the head of the household who is earning minimum wage , [he (PRP)| the chamber's Mr. de Bernardo (NNP)] says 
The historical goal has been a minimum wage equal to half the average wage for non-supervisory private workers , which is currently $ 8.88 an hour 
Reaching a consensus among the bill's backers has been difficult as strategists try to balance the concerns of labor and other interests with political expediency 
Considerations include what , if anything , might be palatable to the White House and what would draw enough support to override a veto 
Republicans have warned [they (PRP)| the bill's backers (NNS)] may counter the push to expand the minimum wage with a long-sought subminimum wage for teens , but an administration official says no decision has yet been made on [its (PRP$)| no decision (NN)] position on an increase
