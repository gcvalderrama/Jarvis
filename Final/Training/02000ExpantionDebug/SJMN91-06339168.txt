No one expected John Sununu to go gently 
And [he (PRP)| John Sununu (NNP)] did not 
; As [his (PRP$)| John Sununu (NNP)] final act , the man hired by President Bush to be [his (PRP$)| John Sununu (NNP)] political hatchet man took a swipe at the boss 
Sununu submitted his resignation , effective Dec. 15 , in a five-page handwritten letter to Bush as they flew to Florida for a speech at a juice factory Tuesday. ; The former New Hampshire governor , ending weeks of speculation and criticism of [his (PRP$)| The former New Hampshire governor (NN)] performance , told Bush in the letter [he (PRP)| The former New Hampshire governor (NN)] would never want to not be contributing positively , much less be a drag on your success 
; In thinly veiled comments , Sununu made [it (PRP)| his resignation (NN)] clear that [he (PRP)| John Sununu (NNP)] felt betrayed because , in many ways , [he (PRP)| John Sununu (NNP)] was doing exactly what Bush had hired [him (PRP)| President Bush (NNP)] to do. ; The departing chief of staff was also obliquely reminding the president that this was not a matter of principle , but of ratings ; [his (PRP$)| John Sununu (NNP)] bullying tactics had been fine as long as the opinion polls did not go down. ; [I (PRP)| John Sununu (NNP)] assure [you (PRP)| The former New Hampshire governor (NN)] that in pit-bull mode or pussycat mode ([your (PRP$)| The former New Hampshire governor (NN)] choice , as always ), [I (PRP)| John Sununu (NNP)] am ready to help , Sununu wrote. ; [His (PRP$)| John Sununu (NNP)] reference was sardonic 
[He (PRP)| John Sununu (NNP)] had called [himself (PRP)| John Sununu (NNP)] a pussycat and kept a plush cat on top of the bookcase in [his (PRP$)| John Sununu (NNP)] large West Wing office 
But , at close range , it was clear that the toy animal was really a tiger , and that is exactly how Sununu saw himself. ; As [he (PRP)| John Sununu (NNP)] stated [his (PRP$)| John Sununu (NNP)] credo in [his (PRP$)| John Sununu (NNP)] first month in Washington : [I (PRP)| John Sununu (NNP)] do not care if people hate [me (PRP)| John Sununu (NNP)] , as long as [they (PRP)| people (NNS)] hate [me (PRP)| John Sununu (NNP)] for the right reasons 
; Bush and Sununu formed a close bond during the 1988 campaign , in the snows of New Hampshire , when Bush saw [his (PRP$)| President Bush (NNP)] presidential dream slipping away after a humiliating showing in Iowa. ; Whatever [they (PRP)| people (NNS)] did in Iowa , [they (PRP)| people (NNS)] will not reject George Bush in New Hampshire , Sununu vowed , as [he (PRP)| George Bush in New Hampshire (NNP)] dragged Bush down from [his (PRP$)| George Bush in New Hampshire (NNP)] elite perch to start what [he (PRP)| George Bush in New Hampshire (NNP)] called a see [me (PRP)| President Bush (NNP)] , touch [me (PRP)| President Bush (NNP)] , feel [me (PRP)| President Bush (NNP)] campaign among the people. ; But it was Sununu who embodied the barbed-wire side of Bush's politics ; in many critical ways , [he (PRP)| President Bush (NNP)] was an accurate reflection of the way Bush believed things should work. ; During the 1988 campaign , Bush conceded in interviews that [he (PRP)| President Bush (NNP)] had to do some of the dirty work in attacking Dukakis ; [his (PRP$)| President Bush (NNP)] alternating nice and nasty faces came to be known as George the Gentle and George the Ripper 
; But as president , Bush preferred to farm out to aides the duties of bully and gunslinger. ; By making the abrasive former governor of New Hampshire [his (PRP$)| the abrasive former governor of New Hampshire (NN)] chief of staff , Bush hoped that [he (PRP)| the abrasive former governor of New Hampshire (NN)] could keep a certain balance of rough and smooth in [his governing (PRP$)| the abrasive former governor of New Hampshire (NN)] and in [his (PRP$)| the abrasive former governor of New Hampshire (NN)] politics. ; In the many times over the past three years when Sununu helped land the president in the political soup , the Washington political cognoscenti speculated that Bush was keeping [his (PRP$)| President Bush (NNP)] chief of staff only out of loyalty to Sununu for helping [him (PRP)| President Bush (NNP)] win the New Hampshire primary , or because Bush was too nice to fire anyone , or because [he (PRP)| President Bush (NNP)] was too indecisive. ; The truth is more complicated , and Sununu put his finger on [it (PRP)| his finger (NN)] Tuesday 
While Sununu's lack of political skill in dealing with political Washington eventually cost [him (PRP)| John Sununu (NNP)] [his (PRP$)| John Sununu (NNP)] job , and while [his (PRP$)| John Sununu (NNP)] fatal flaw may have been in believing that [he (PRP)| John Sununu (NNP)] was smarter than Bush , the chief of staff was often in an inept way trying to fulfill the mandate [he (PRP)| John Sununu (NNP)] had been given by [his (PRP$)| John Sununu (NNP)] boss. ; In many critical ways , Sununu exacerbated Bush's limitations , rather than making up for [them (PRP)| aides (NNS)] , and whenever the spotlight swung away from foreign affairs , it became painfully apparent that this was a White House without a long-range agenda , without a communications strategy and without first-rate thinkers in many top jobs. ; As Bush tried to be the ultimate Washington insider , the chief of staff alienated Congress , Cabinet members , House Republicans and the press , who disdained Sununu because [they (PRP)| aides (NNS)] believed [he (PRP)| John Sununu (NNP)] misled [them (PRP)| aides (NNS)] 
Sununu even tried to manipulate [his (PRP$)| John Sununu (NNP)] boss on occasion , with the effect that Bush looked weak and waffling. ; When the glow faded from the Persian Gulf war , and the country began looking to the White House for leadership on the stagnant economy and the pain of many Americans , the president once again allowed [himself (PRP)| many Americans (NNPS)] to be guided by Sununu and [his (PRP$)| many Americans (NNPS)] closest White House ally , Richard Darman , the budget chief. ; Sununu and Darman urged the president to follow [his (PRP$)| John Sununu (NNP)] instincts that there was nothing [he (PRP)| John Sununu (NNP)] could do about the economy and that [he (PRP)| John Sununu (NNP)] should not even try to come up with a drastic plan. ; Moreover , in the recent fiasco about caps on credit card interest rates , Sununu did something that is never done in a city that operates strictly on hierarchy : [He (PRP)| John Sununu (NNP)] blamed the mess on [his (PRP$)| John Sununu (NNP)] boss , going on national television to say Bush had ad-libbed the idea in a speech. ; Bush appeared out of sync with the country 
[His (PRP$)| John Sununu (NNP)] approval ratings began dropping again 
Important Republicans scorned by Sununu began going on the record with [their (PRP$)| Sununu and Darman (NNP)] advice to Bush that [he (PRP)| Important Republicans scorned by Sununu (NNPS)] was being ill served by [his (PRP$)| Important Republicans scorned by Sununu (NNPS)] chief of staff. ; And finally and most important , the president's wife , Barbara , and oldest son , George , turned on Sununu. ; And so , finally , Bush invited Sununu to resign. ; In accepting Sununu's letter of resignation , Bush said [he (PRP)| John Sununu (NNP)] regretted but supported Sununu's good decision 
[He (PRP)| Important Republicans scorned by Sununu (NNPS)] said [his (PRP$)| Important Republicans scorned by Sununu (NNPS)] aide would remain on at the White House until March 1 as a presidential counselor with Cabinet rank. ; Now Bush must find another chief of staff , and another hired hatchet 
But this time , [his (PRP$)| Important Republicans scorned by Sununu (NNPS)] friends say , [he (PRP)| Important Republicans scorned by Sununu (NNPS)] will look for aides who can play those roles while also playing by the rules of the Washington game. ; While sources said Transportation Secretary Sam Skinner headed the list of candidates , White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said today [he (PRP)| Transportation Secretary Sam Skinner (NNP)] did not believe Bush had made the offer to Skinner. ; Others said to be in the running were Defense Secretary Dick Cheney , who was chief of staff under President Ford ; former GOP Rep. Bill Frenzel of Minnesota ; and former New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean , a strong Bush loyalist who now is president of Drew University
