Anita Hill took a lie detector test Sunday and the polygraph expert who administered [it (PRP)| Sunday (NNP)] said [she (PRP)| Anita Hill (NNP)] is telling the truth in accusing Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment. ; Polygraph expert Paul K. Minor told reporters that Hill did not deceive the Senate Judiciary Committee when [she (PRP)| Anita Hill (NNP)] testified Friday that Thomas had discussed pornographic material and various sex acts with [her (PRP)| Anita Hill (NNP)] 
Trying to save [her (PRP$)| Anita Hill (NNP)] name ; Charles Ogletree , a Harvard law professor and one of Hill's lawyers , said Hill wanted to take the test to refute the attacks made on her motives and integrity by Republican senators Saturday. ; However , the significance of polygraph tests is limited 
[They (PRP)| Charles Ogletree , a Harvard law professor and one of Hill's lawyers (NNP)] are not admitted as evidence in most courtrooms because the scientific community believes [they (PRP)| Charles Ogletree , a Harvard law professor and one of Hill's lawyers (NNP)] are insufficiently reliable and judges believe juries give [them (PRP)| juries (NNS)] too much weight. ; The danger of polygraph tests is that some people are able to fool lie detectors because [they (PRP)| some people (NNS)] believe what [they (PRP)| some people (NNS)] are saying , even though it is not true , Georgetown University criminal law professor Paul Rothstein said. ; What Hill was asked ; Minor , a well known polygraph expert who has taught FBI polygraph operators , said [he (PRP)| Polygraph expert Paul K. Minor (NNP)] put four questions to Hill : ; (check )Have you deliberately lied to me about Clarence Thomas ? 
; (check )Are you fabricating the allegation that Clarence Thomas discussed pornographic material with you ? 
; (check )Are you lying to me about the various topics that Clarence Thomas mentioned to you regarding specific sexual acts ? 
; (check )Are you lying to me about Clarence Thomas making references to you about the size of [his (PRP$)| Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment. (NNP)] penis ? 
; She answered no to each question 
There was no indication of deception to any of the relevant questions , Minor said outside the hearing room 
[It (PRP)| no indication of deception (NN)] is therefore [my (PRP$)| Polygraph expert Paul K. Minor (NNP)] opinion Ms. Hill is truthful 
; Sen. Howard Metzenbaum asked that Hill's polygraph results be placed in the committee record , but chairman Joseph Biden , D-Del. , refused , noting that courts did not accept such evidence and that the test had been produced outside committee control. ; Nevertheless , Rothstein said , polygraphs are 60 to 80 percent reliable , depending upon whom [you (PRP)| Polygraph expert Paul K. Minor (NNP)] ask , and Peter Tague , also a Georgetown criminal law specialist , said that Prof. Hill's willingness to take a polygraph test tends to support [her (PRP$)| Anita Hill (NNP)] credibility 
; The devices purport to detect untruthful answers by measuring changes in blood pressure , pulse rate and perspiration. ; While [he (PRP)| Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (NNP)] is considered to be a prominent expert in [his (PRP$)| Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (NNP)] field , Minor's reputation is not without controversy. ; In July 1980 , Minor , who was then with the FBI , administered two polygraph tests to Herman Sillas , then the U.S. attorney in Sacramento , to determine the veracity of allegations that [he (PRP)| Herman Sillas (NNP)] had taken a $ 7,500 bribe from a prison inmate several years earlier 
The test was later determined to have been improperly administered. ; Minor could not be reached for comment Sunday
