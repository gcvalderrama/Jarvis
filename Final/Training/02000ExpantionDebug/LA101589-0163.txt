Michael Milken may be gone from Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. , but [his (PRP$)| Michael Milken (NNP)] deal-making days are not done 
On the eighth floor of the United Artists building on North Roxbury Drive in Beverly Hills , just a couple of blocks from [his (PRP$)| Michael Milken (NNP)] old perch on Drexel's junk bond trading desk , carpets have been laid , wallpaper is up and furniture delivered 
Milken's new company , International Capital Access Group , is open for business 
Despite the racketeering and securities fraud indictment hanging over [him (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] and [his (PRP$)| Michael Milken (NNP)] forced resignation from Drexel in June , Milken has not retreated to the sidelines 
When Drexel's former junk bond chief announced plans for the firm , [he (PRP)| Drexel's former junk bond chief (NN)] said [it (PRP)| Drexel's (NNP)] would help members of minority groups and unions raise the capital to own companies 
And , four months after [it (PRP)| four months (NNS)] was founded , ICAG appears to be doing just that 
But the new firm is also gearing up for a considerable amount of potentially more profitable business 
Since leaving Drexel , Milken has had talks with many of his old firm's clients , according to a senior Drexel executive 
And in a long interview in ICAG's offices , Milken confirmed that a significant part of ICAG's business will be with ordinary companies 
[It (PRP)| ICAG's (NN)] may make direct investments in companies 
And [it (PRP)| ICAG's (NN)] is working on finding new capital for successful companies and refinancing firms that are in trouble 
In exchange for Milken's brainpower and contacts in arranging refinancing , ICAG expects to receive an ownership stake in most of the companies that [it (PRP)| an ownership stake (NN)] helps 
What [we (PRP)| the companies (NNS)] are doing here is pretty much what we were doing before (at Drexel ), in the sense that his focus is on finding ways for companies to raise capital , Milken says , although he no longer trades or underwrites securities 
Milken , however , protests any suggestion that the firm's main purpose is to make money 
All of its activities , [he (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] says , fall under the category of helping people 
[He (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] refuses to discuss ICAG's fees or even confirm that [he (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] expects the company to be profitable 
Financial reporters have this preoccupation with money , [he (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] says 
We are focused on creating value 
Wealth is a byproduct 
Several times during the interview , the man who earned $ 550 million in one year at Drexel , and is estimated to be worth well over $ 1 billion , complained that people are so hung up on money 
At Drexel , Milken essentially created the market for high-yield , high-risk junk bonds , and [he (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] revolutionized the way that capital was raised for medium-sized U.S. companies 
[He (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] also turned junk bonds into a potent tool in corporate takeovers and leveraged buyouts 
Now , Milken seems determined to prove that the government's case against [him (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] will not stop [him (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] from carrying out [his (PRP$)| Michael Milken (NNP)] ideas 
An ordinary person might be overwhelmed by the chore of preparing a legal defense against a 98-count felony indictment 
But Stephen Weinroth , a longtime Drexel official now on leave , says : Mike has an energy level that makes a nuclear plant look pathetic 
In the short time since ICAG was formed , [it (PRP)| the time (NN)] already has purchased $ 2.5 million worth of barges and other equipment to lease to Unimar International Inc. , a Seattle-based shipbuilder and tugboat company that was bought out by its unionized employees with Drexel's help in 1987 
Milken says ICAG plans to do this for other employee-owned companies as well , since many of them have trouble raising the money to buy equipment outright 
Among activities involving minorities , Milken has put groups of minority businessmen in contact with potential backers 
And Bill Tatum , publisher of New York's black newspaper , the Amsterdam News , says [he (PRP)| Bill Tatum (NNP)] met with Milken about backing for a bid on a major general-circulation newspaper , perhaps the troubled Daily News 
Milken says that helping unions and members of minority groups , and devising ways to help indebted countries , such as Mexico , will make up more than half of ICAG's business 
In addition to these areas , Milken already is doing a considerable amount of mainstream business 
[He (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] says [he (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] has agreed to help recapitalize an entertainment and publishing concern , which [he (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] wo not identify 
[He (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] is working on bailing out Weintraub Entertainment Group , a Los Angeles company that was straining under its junk bond debt after a string of unsuccessful movies 
[He (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] is helping to arrange financing for a Los Angeles chain of car dealerships 
And [he (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] says that enough progress has been made on some deals that they may soon be announced publicly 
Milken says that , in all , [he (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] has been approached by several hundred companies 
Of these , ICAG is doing work on behalf of about 30 
[He (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] says that 12 of these already are at the point where a transaction has occurred or is about to 
Milken wo not comment on the terms on which ICAG is helping these companies , but one deal that fell through suggests that , while [his (PRP$)| Michael Milken (NNP)] aim may be to help others , [he (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] is not neglecting [his (PRP$)| Michael Milken (NNP)] own interests 
Wolfgang Puck , the well-known chef and proprietor of the Los Angeles restaurant Spago , said [he (PRP)| Wolfgang Puck (NNP)] approached Milken in July about raising new financing for Puck's frozen pizza venture , Wolfgang Puck Food Co. 
In an interview , Puck said [he (PRP)| Wolfgang Puck (NNP)] was not able to come to terms with ICAG 
Puck said [he (PRP)| Wolfgang Puck (NNP)] balked when Milken demanded a majority stake in the company 
Milken says [he (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] was not directly involved in the Puck negotiations , and denies that [they (PRP)| Wolfgang Puck , the well-known chef and proprietor of the Los Angeles restaurant Spago (NNP)] fell through because of the ownership issue 
[He (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] says Puck's company at the time was in financial difficulties and needed a lot of financing 
([It (PRP)| Puck's company at the time (NN)] has since obtained some financing elsewhere )
[He (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] says that the talks broke down because [they (PRP)| Wolfgang Puck , the well-known chef and proprietor of the Los Angeles restaurant Spago (NNP)] involved too many lenders and stockholders who simply could not come to terms on a variety of issues 
Milken's challenge in establishing a new firm will be to overcome serious handicaps imposed by [his (PRP$)| Michael Milken (NNP)] pending criminal prosecution 
ICAG can not trade or underwrite securities 
Such activities were a main part of Milken's activities at Drexel 
But they require licensing by the Securities and Exchange Commission 
From a legal standpoint , Milken could apply for such licenses , since [he (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] has yet to be convicted of anything 
For practical reasons , however , [he (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] has chosen not to , and so must rely on other firms to perform these services for [his (PRP$)| Michael Milken (NNP)] clients 
Asked if [it (PRP)| a legal standpoint (NN)] bothers [him (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] that [he (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] can no longer issue new securities , Milken says , [it (PRP)| a legal standpoint (NN)] is not something [I (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] am thinking about at this time 
Investment banking sources say that Milken , in effect , also is closed out of doing work for the gambling industry , which made up a big share of [his (PRP$)| Michael Milken (NNP)] clients at Drexel 
Because [he (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] is under indictment , New Jersey and Nevada gaming authorities have indicated that [they (PRP)| New Jersey and Nevada gaming authorities (NNS)] might take legal steps against casino operators who do business with [him (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] 
And though Milken's press spokesman and personal lawyer strongly deny [it (PRP)| New Jersey (NNP)] , a number of potential clients are frightened of having [their (PRP$)| Milken's press spokesman and personal lawyer (NN)] names publicly associated with [him (PRP)| Milken's press spokesman (NN)] 
In an off-the-record interview , the chief executive of a publicly traded company who was a client of Milken's at Drexel and praises Milken effusively said that [he (PRP)| the chief executive of a publicly traded company who was a client of Milken's at Drexel and praises Milken effusively (NN)] could not afford to have any formal business relationship with ICAG 
[He (PRP)| the chief executive of a publicly traded company who was a client of Milken's at Drexel and praises Milken effusively (NN)] said the commercial banks with which [his (PRP$)| the chief executive of a publicly traded company who was a client of Milken's at Drexel and praises Milken effusively (NN)] company does business have indicated that [they (PRP)| Milken's press spokesman and personal lawyer (NN)] might stop lending to [him (PRP)| the chief executive of a publicly traded company who was a client of Milken's at Drexel and praises Milken effusively (NN)] if [he (PRP)| the chief executive of a publicly traded company who was a client of Milken's at Drexel and praises Milken effusively (NN)] does 
Some banks , [he (PRP)| the chief executive of a publicly traded company who was a client of Milken's at Drexel and praises Milken effusively (NN)] said , have decided that Milken is not a credible person right now 
This has not stopped a flood of companies that have approached [him (PRP)| the chief executive of a publicly traded company who was a client of Milken's at Drexel and praises Milken effusively (NN)] in confidence , however 
And there are still plenty of well-known executives who praise Milken publicly and wish [his (PRP$)| Michael Milken (NNP)] company success 
Steven J. Ross , co-chairman of the recently merged Time Warner Inc. , said : Mike has to be one of the most brilliant financial minds of [our (PRP$)| well-known executives (NNS)] time 
But Ross would not say if [he (PRP)| Steven J. Ross (NNP)] expects to use ICAG's services 
[We (PRP)| well-known executives (NNS)] have factors that [we (PRP)| well-known executives (NNS)] never make public about any of [our (PRP$)| well-known executives (NNS)] business dealings , [he (PRP)| Steven J. Ross (NNP)] said , adding : That is not to be construed that [we (PRP)| well-known executives (NNS)] are or are not 
In true Milken style , ICAG's new offices are comfortable but not ostentatious 
Only the firm's name , not Milken's , is on the door 
And [he (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] refers to everyone who works there as co-workers , not employees 
The heart of the firm is a long rectangular table made up of 18 wooden desks pushed together 
Complete with financial data computer screens , [it (PRP)| a long rectangular table made up of 18 wooden desks pushed together (NN)] looks remarkably like a trading desk 
It is an environment that evidently makes Milken feel at home ; [his (PRP$)| Michael Milken (NNP)] years in Drexel's Beverly Hills office were spent at the center of the junk bond trading desk 
But at this one , for the foreseeable future , no securities will be traded 
The firm currently has about 20 employees , with more expected to join soon 
(Milken says [he (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] does not know how many )
Among the top staff members , whom Milken calls principals , are Steven Fink , a former official at Pacific Asset Holdings (a partnership in which Milken holds an interest ), Lorraine Spurge , formerly one of his top assistants at Drexel , and Randolph Read , former president of a merchant banking concern 
Officials at the new firm say [they (PRP)| Officials at the new firm (NNS)] are are not making overtures to lure Drexel employees to ICAG 
But Milken does not rule out talking to former Drexel colleagues who may , on their own , contact [him (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] about a job 
[He (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] refuses to discuss how much capital the firm has , a key measure of the potential scope of its activities 
[It (PRP)| how much capital the firm has , a key measure of the potential scope of its activities (NN)] is a private firm , [he (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] says 
Milken did say that all of the firm's capital comes from himself and the principal staff members , not outsiders 
There are a number of people who have called , but [we (PRP)| outsiders (NNS)] felt [it (PRP)| a number of people who have called (NN)] would be better that [we (PRP)| outsiders (NNS)] did not take in outside backers , [he (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] said 
But one clue to the amount of money that Milken personally is committing to the firm is how much [he (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] says ICAG is willing to invest in an individual transaction 
For most types of transactions , [he (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] says , the firm stands ready to invest between $ 500,000 and $ 20 million 
Milken draws a sharp distinction between [his (PRP$)| Michael Milken (NNP)] goals and those of Bruce Wasserstein and Joseph R. Perella , formerly of First Boston Corp. , who , like Milken , left a big Wall Street firm to set up shop on their own 
Their new firm , Wasserstein Perella & Co. , was established as a corporate takeover boutique 
In contrast , Milken says , you will not find us involved in any unfriendly transactions 
Although Milken is credited with inventing the use of junk bonds to back hostile corporate raids , [he (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] maintains that hostile transactions have never been a major focus of mine 
Milken adds : There is so much we can do to help people , [I (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] just do not think [it (PRP)| the use of junk bonds (NN)] is something we are interested in 
By helping companies , Milken means suggesting ways that [they (PRP)| companies (NNS)] could improve [their (PRP$)| companies (NNS)] basic business , working out creative means of raising capital or recapitalizing to reduce interest costs , and using [his (PRP$)| Michael Milken (NNP)] vast network of contacts to put companies in touch with potential investors 
After a speech [he (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] made in September , Milken was widely quoted as suggesting that companies should now attempt to reduce [their (PRP$)| companies (NNS)] level of high-yield debt 
Some analysts interpreted this as a major reversal , since Milken's later years at Drexel were largely spent promoting leveraged buyouts financed with huge chunks of junk-bond debt 
But Milken maintains that [he (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] is simply doing what [he (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] has always done , advising companies to profit from market conditions 
One service that ICAG expects to perform is finding creative ways for its customers to convert their costly high-interest debt into a combination of lower-interest debt and equity that is , stock 
Milken says [his (PRP$)| Michael Milken (NNP)] firm expects to help salvage some of the large companies that have been in the news in the last couple of months because of severe difficulties in meeting the payments on their junk debt 
There are some companies today that are not knocking the cover off the ball , and yes , we are willing to help , [he (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] says 
Milken declines to discuss individual companies but denies that the debt per se caused [their (PRP$)| individual companies (NNS)] problems 
As ICAG takes on customers , one thorny issue is [its (PRP$)| one thorny issue (NN)] relations with current Drexel customers 
When Drexel settled a massive SEC lawsuit , the firm agreed not to do business directly or indirectly with Milken 
What this means precisely has not been defined and could be a source of further SEC action 
It is not clear , for example , whether legal problems would arise if a company hired Drexel to underwrite securities according to a recapitalization plan drawn up by Milken 
Milken's lawyers are interpreting the provision to be Drexel's problem , not [his (PRP$)| Michael Milken (NNP)] 
(A Milken adviser notes that Milken is not a party to the settlement with the SEC )
Still , the adviser acknowledges that [it (PRP)| the settlement with the SEC (NN)] is something that exists , and [we (PRP)| Milken's lawyers (NNS)] are conscious of [it (PRP)| the settlement with the SEC (NN)] 
Some current Drexel clients say [they (PRP)| Some current Drexel clients (NNS)] would not be troubled by feelings of disloyalty if [they (PRP)| Some current Drexel clients (NNS)] also decided to seek help from ICAG 
Oscar U. Mutz , president and chief executive of Forum Group , an Indianapolis developer of retirement communities that is a Drexel customer , says : [I (PRP)| Oscar U. Mutz , president and chief executive of Forum Group , an Indianapolis developer of retirement communities that is a Drexel customer (NNP)] do not ask Drexel's permission to go see Morgan Stanley (another Wall Street investment bank ), and [I (PRP)| Oscar U. Mutz , president and chief executive of Forum Group , an Indianapolis developer of retirement communities that is a Drexel customer (NNP)] do not ask Drexel's permission to go see Michael Milken or anybody else 
Mutz , however , says [he (PRP)| Oscar U. Mutz (NNP)] has not yet had occasion to do business with ICAG 
Steven Anreder , Drexel's spokesman , says the firm has not lost any clients to ICAG 
And [he (PRP)| Steven Anreder (NNP)] said [he (PRP)| Steven Anreder (NNP)] does not expect conflicts to develop 
Milken , who was one of the most feared competitors on Wall Street when [he (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] was at Drexel , now frequently is funneling to other firms the trading and underwriting business that [he (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] can no longer do [himself (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] 
One ICAG staff member says Milken's old competitors today are more than happy to do business with [him (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] , now that [he (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] is no longer directly competing 
The reality is that [we (PRP)| Milken's old competitors (NNS)] can generate a lot of business for people , the staff member says 
Milken [himself (PRP)| One ICAG staff member (NN)] takes pains to downplay [his (PRP$)| Michael Milken (NNP)] former role as competitor , saying that as a former buyer and seller of securities , [he (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] always had to maintain good relationships with other firms 
One big , unanswered question is what will become of the firm if Milken is convicted and sent to prison 
[His (PRP$)| Michael Milken (NNP)] trial is scheduled for March , and [he (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] faces the possibility of a lengthy sentence 
[He (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] denies any wrongdoing and is vigorously fighting the charges 
Milken and staff members say [they (PRP)| the top staff members , whom Milken calls principals , (NNS)] are hoping for the best and , no matter what happens , [they (PRP)| the top staff members , whom Milken calls principals , (NNS)] expect ICAG to remain in business and grow 
Meanwhile , Time Warner's Ross says : [He (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] is got such a brilliant mind that [I (PRP)| Time Warner's Ross (NNP)] think [he (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] could do 10 things at one time and still prepare for what [he (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] is about to undergo
