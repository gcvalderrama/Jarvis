Some of the police officers who stood by while others beat black motorist Rodney King maintain to this day that his traffic stop was handled properly , District Attorney Ira Reiner said Friday. ; The revelation came in Reiner's announcement that the county's grand jury had decided not to indict the bystanders because no state laws make their inaction criminal 
Reiner said [he (PRP)| District Attorney Ira Reiner (NNP)] is referring the case to the U.S. attorney for review under federal civil rights laws , which are broader than California's 
Near the end of his prepared statement , the district attorney said that while many of the bystander officers were deeply disturbed by what occurred , ... to this day , some of the officers present do not acknowledge that the incident should have been handled any differently than [it (PRP)| the incident (NN)] was 
; Because the beating still is under investigation , [he (PRP)| District Attorney Ira Reiner (NNP)] declined to elaborate or answer reportersquestions 
But [he (PRP)| District Attorney Ira Reiner (NNP)] said [he (PRP)| District Attorney Ira Reiner (NNP)] would forward the disturbing interviews to the local independent commission investigating the police department 
The commission has no disciplinary power. ; [I (PRP)| Mark Ridley-Thomas , a city council candidate and executive director of this area's chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (NNP)] could not be more disappointed , said Mark Ridley-Thomas , a city council candidate and executive director of this area's chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference 
[We (PRP)| a city council candidate and executive director of this area's chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (NN)] had expectations that these lawbreakers and passive though [they (PRP)| reporters(NNS)] may have been , [they (PRP)| reporters(NNS)] were lawbreakers would be dealt with accordingly ... 
[We (PRP)| a city council candidate and executive director of this area's chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (NN)] have not given up on this 
; The American Civil Liberties Union plans to see whether it can take any legal action on the grand jury's decision. ; Some of these officers have strongly defended the activities surrounding Rodney King ... which is an incredible thing to say under investigation , ACLU spokesman Joe Hicks said 
[We (PRP)| a city council candidate and executive director of this area's chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (NN)] do not have a lot of confidence in the justice department and ([its (PRP$)| a lot of confidence (NN)] )past record of investigation and prosecution of police abuse around the country 
; The Los Angeles Times reported that the grand jury heard from seven officers , including five rookies who witnessed King's arrest 
The rookies said the scene that night was chaotic and noisy , that King appeared dangerous and possibly high on PCP , and that the sergeant there seemed to be in charge 
Officers reportedly were not asked why [they (PRP)| seven officers (NNS)] did not try to stop the beating. ; In [his (PRP$)| the beating. (NN)] statement , Reiner said that however morally wrong [their (PRP$)| seven officers (NNS)] failure to intercede , in California law , there is no criminal statute under which these officers can be indicted ... 
Because the behavior of the bystander officers was both irresponsible and offensive , and in light of the unprecedented public furor over this case , the grand jury is to be commended for remaining true to [their (PRP$)| seven officers (NNS)] duty 
; King's March 3 beating , captured on videotape , spawned outrage throughout the world and led to criminal charges by the grand jury against four Los Angeles Police Department officers. ; Police Chief Daryl Gates earlier this week fired one of the officers , a rookie still on probation , and suspended the other three without pay pending hearings that could lead to [their (PRP$)| seven officers (NNS)] dismissal. ; Besides those four , at least 17 other LAPD officers were present at the scene of the beating 
There also were two from the California Highway Patrol and two from the Los Angeles Unified School District. ; The police department's internal investigation of its bystanders is continuing , Cmdr. Rick Dinse said 
While [he (PRP)| Cmdr. Rick Dinse (NNP)] would not discuss the investigation or [its (PRP$)| The police department's internal investigation of its bystanders (NN)] results , Dinse said that behavior does not have to be criminal for [us (PRP)| the bystanders (NNS)] to take action 
; Only the police chief has the power , after extensive review , to discipline officers 
Whether Chief Gates will be the one to rule on these officers remains a question 
A Superior Court judge is reviewing whether the city's police commission had the right to put Gates on leave last month , and whether the city council has the right to reinstate [him (PRP)| A Superior Court judge (NN)]
