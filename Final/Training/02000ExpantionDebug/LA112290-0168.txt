Despite what you may be reading , Michael Milken is not a bloodless monster who set out to pillage the world and drown [it (PRP)| the world (NN)] in a sea of debt 
[He (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] is a very smart , very driven and very flawed human being whose life and whose life's work has been completely destroyed 
Anyone who does not feel at least a tinge of compassion for the man does not have an ounce of compassion in [his (PRP$)| Anyone who does not feel at least a tinge of compassion for the man (NN)] body 
Milken is not a symbol of the 1980s , whatever that means 
[He (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] is just a guy who was in the right place at the right time he started dealing in junk bonds when bargains were lying around like truffles on the forest floor who took a good idea much too far 
The idea was that the rewards of owning junk bonds more than outweighed the risks of the borrowers going belly up 
Milken took [it (PRP)| a good idea (NN)] too far by insisting that junk bonds securities that carry high risks and high interest rates were suitable for everyone 
Which , in fact , [they (PRP)| the borrowers going belly up (NNS)] are not , as the current crash in the junk market or in what remains of the junk market shows 
Milken was obsessed with getting more and more people to accept the Gospel of Junk , and [he (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] almost single-handedly turned junk from a backwater of finance into a mainstream investment 
Making junk mainstream is what did Milken in and ultimately what did in the junk bond market 
When the junk market was small and had few players , people had no one to deal with but Milken , and [he (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] could keep weak borrowers out of the market 
Once other brokerage houses decided to go after the junk business , Milken's competitive juices and [his (PRP$)| Michael Milken (NNP)] obsession with controlling every aspect of everything in his life compelled [him (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] to do whatever sleazy things [it (PRP)| the junk business (NN)] took to nail down business 
If junk had stayed a backwater and if either the enforcers at the Securities and Exchange Commission or Milken's alleged superiors at Drexel Burnham Lambert reined Milken in [he (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] would not be going to jail 
But the SEC did not go after Milken until a trail of stool pigeons fingered Ivan F. Boesky , who fingered Milken 
And instead of supervising Milken , top Drexel officials averted [their (PRP$)| top Drexel officials (NNS)] eyes to avoid seeing [his (PRP$)| Michael Milken (NNP)] sin 
In fact , Drexel let Milken move the entire junk department from New York City to [his (PRP$)| Michael Milken (NNP)] native California 
Milken's department was making so much money that Drexel Chairman Frederick H. Joseph let Milken do whatever [he (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] wanted because Joseph needed the Milken-generated profits to turn Drexel into a mainline brokerage house 
To understand Milken , you have to understand that when [he (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] wandered into the world of junk bonds at a third-rate Philadelphia brokerage house in the 1970s , the junk market consisted of a handful of canny investors who spent [their (PRP$)| canny investors (NNS)] days searching through the rubble of financially distressed companies searching for securities that were better than [they (PRP)| canny investors (NNS)] looked 
Because Milken is very smart , has a good head for numbers and could work incredible hours , [he (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] found more of these little jewels than anyone else did 
Soon , [he (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] persuaded [his (PRP$)| Michael Milken (NNP)] bosses to give [him (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] enough money to keep an inventory of junk around 
This meant that when early junkmeisters Saul P. Steinberg of Reliance Insurance , Laurence A. Tisch of Loews , Carl Lindner of Penn Central and American Financial , to name a few wanted to buy or sell junk , [they (PRP)| early junkmeisters Saul P. Steinberg of Reliance Insurance , Laurence A. Tisch of Loews , Carl Lindner of Penn Central and American Financial , to name a few (NNS)] had to deal with Milken 
But as the market for junk grew larger mainly because of what Michael was doing Milken wanted to keep all the business 
To do that , [he (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] financed deals that [he (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] knew [he (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] should never have touched , and [he (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] went so far as to offer secret goodies to people who had money to invest in junk 
That way , [he (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] bound these people to [him (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] 
When the market was small , no one knew or cared what Milken was doing 
When [it (PRP)| the junk market (NN)] got big and when [he (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] began raising money for a band of corporate brigands to take over mainline U.S. companies like Gulf Oil and Union Carbide that was a different game 
[He (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] was used to operating without anyone knowing what [he (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] was doing , and [he (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] did not understand that the rules had changed , and [he (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] had to clean up [his (PRP$)| Michael Milken (NNP)] act 
Milken , being a complicated guy , has conflicting tendencies 
On the one hand , [he (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] lives very modestly and always talks about how important [it (PRP)| the one hand (NN)] is not to take on airs 
On the other hand , [he (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] felt [himself (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] smarter than anybody , and thought [he (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] could indefinitely get away with sleazy things 
Such as telling bond issuers that bond buyers wanted cheap stock as a sweetener , then keeping the stock for [himself (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] and a handful of associates 
During 1987 , 1988 and 1989 , I spent many hours with Milken , whom I came to consider a friend 
[He (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] was brilliant , but [he (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] had no sense of humor and no sense of how other people perceived [him (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] 
[He (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] did not blame [himself (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] for [his (PRP$)| Michael Milken (NNP)] problems , [he (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] blamed the news media 
And probably still does 
Milken has lost almost everything that [he (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] holds dear 
[He (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] used to pride [himself (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] on being a quiet donor of huge amounts to charity and of working , unheralded , with disadvantaged children 
But [he (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] decided to let [his (PRP$)| Michael Milken (NNP)] public relations people turn charity into a PR show 
[He (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] used to pride [himself (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] on having established the junk bond market 
But that market is gone , and many of his most important junk clients Columbia Savings & Loan of Beverly Hills , First Executive Corp. of Los Angeles are busto , and many others , such as Lindner and Steinberg seem to be in big trouble 
He prided himself on his staff's loyalty to him but many of [them (PRP)| his most important junk clients (NNS)] turned state's evidence 
By the time Milken broke down and cried several times Wednesday , it was far too late for [him (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] to be considered a human being 
[He (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] was sentenced as the Beast of the 80s , but [he (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] will suffer as a man 
Yes , Milken still has a vast fortune 
But [his (PRP$)| Michael Milken (NNP)] life and work are in ruins , and [he (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] will spend who knows how many years in the slammer while [his (PRP$)| Michael Milken (NNP)] kids grow up and leave home 
Even though [he (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] brought [it (PRP)| the slammer (NN)] on [himself (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] , watching how this man has destroyed [himself (PRP)| Michael Milken (NNP)] is enough to make me want to cry
