Radical reformer Boris N. Yeltsin triumphed over opposition from Mikhail S. Gorbachev to win the presidency of the largest Soviet republic today in what [he (PRP)| Radical reformer Boris N. Yeltsin (NNP)] called Russia's social , economic and spiritual rebirth 
After three hard-fought ballots in the 1,060-member Russian Congress of People's Deputies , Yeltsin won 535 , four more than the majority [he (PRP)| Radical reformer Boris N. Yeltsin (NNP)] needed 
Russian Premier Alexander Vlasov , received 467 ballots 
Yeltsin now poses a substantial challenge to Gorbachev , who retains the two most powerful jobs in the country : president of the Soviet Union and general secretary of the Soviet Communist Party 
However , Gennadi Gerasimov , spokesman for the Soviet Foreign Ministry , said Yeltsin's election could strengthen Gorbachev's campaign for economic reforms 
Yeltsin's victory is an expression of general discontent with how things are going in the Soviet Union's biggest republic , Gerasimov told reporters at the United Nations in New York 
The Soviet Union is a democracy , so [we (PRP)| Radical reformer Boris N. Yeltsin (NNP)] accept what the Russian parliament has decided 
[It (PRP)| the Soviet Union (NNP)] may be a blessing in disguise 
President Gorbachev has [his (PRP$)| Mikhail S. Gorbachev (NNP)] critics from both the left and the right , and possibly it is better to have the election of a critic from the left , [he (PRP)| Gennadi Gerasimov (NNP)] said 
Igor Malashenko , foreign policy advisor to the Communist Party who accompanied Gerasimov at the news conference , agreed 
This victory of Yeltsin has been misinterpreted as a problem for Gorbachev , Malashenko said 
Yeltsin is also a reformer , although [he (PRP)| Radical reformer Boris N. Yeltsin (NNP)] reflects concepts which are different from Gorbachev 
In this respect [I (PRP)| Radical reformer Boris N. Yeltsin (NNP)] believe [it (the election )(PRP)| this respect (NN)] can strengthen the cause of reform in the Soviet Union 
Today , many people blame Gorbachev for problems and now [they (PRP)| many people (NNS)] have another person to blame 
After the election result was announced in the Grand Kremlin Palace , the burly 59-year-old Yeltsin , strode to the podium , received warm applause and cheers from fellow lawmakers , and was handed a bouquet of flowers 
Yeltsin said [he (PRP)| Radical reformer Boris N. Yeltsin (NNP)] felt a certain satisfaction , but at the same time , [I (PRP)| Radical reformer Boris N. Yeltsin (NNP)] have much more a feeling of responsibility at this turning point for Russia and the country 
[I (PRP)| Radical reformer Boris N. Yeltsin (NNP)] pledge not to spare anything _ health or time _ to do everything to get out of this crisis and lead Russia to better times , Yeltsin said in [his (PRP$)| Radical reformer Boris N. Yeltsin (NNP)] victory speech 
[He (PRP)| Radical reformer Boris N. Yeltsin (NNP)] called the day the beginning of the road to Russia's social , economic and spiritual rebirth , the way out of the crisis and toward the blossoming of Russia as a sovereign , independent government in the framework of [our (PRP$)| Radical reformer Boris N. Yeltsin (NNP)] union 
Gorbachev actively opposed Yeltsin's election , telling the Russian Congress last week that [his (PRP$)| Mikhail S. Gorbachev (NNP)] platform of moving political and economic power from central to local authorities would lead to a breakup of the union 
The Russian Federation is by far the largest of the 15 Soviet republics , stretching from the Baltic Sea in the west to the Pacific Ocean in the east 
It is home to one-half the country's 285 million people and includes Moscow 
As the president of Russia , Yeltsin will have a highly visible platform from which to wage [his (PRP$)| the president of Russia (NN)] campaign for more radical reforms than those pursued so far by Gorbachev 
The victory marks an amazing comeback for Yeltsin 
Less than three years ago , [he (PRP)| Radical reformer Boris N. Yeltsin (NNP)] was reviled in the Soviet press , attacked by party officials , rebuffed by [his (PRP$)| Radical reformer Boris N. Yeltsin (NNP)] former mentor , Gorbachev , and considered finished politically 
Gorbachev had brought Yeltsin to Moscow to head the city's Communist Party , but [he (PRP)| Mikhail S. Gorbachev (NNP)] was fired in 1987 after showing little reverance for party hierarchy 
Yeltsin , however , made [his (PRP$)| Radical reformer Boris N. Yeltsin (NNP)] rift with Gorbachev work for [him (PRP)| Radical reformer Boris N. Yeltsin (NNP)] 
The popular and outspoken Yeltsin had lost the second round of voting on Saturday by just 28 votes 
[He (PRP)| Radical reformer Boris N. Yeltsin (NNP)] lost the first round Friday with 497 ballots to 473 for Krasnodar regional Communist Party chief Ivan Polozkov 
[He (PRP)| Radical reformer Boris N. Yeltsin (NNP)] was nominated again Monday and faced Vlasov , who had Gorbachev's support , and Valentin Tsoy , a little-known businessman from the Soviet Far East , who received 11 votes 
After [his (PRP$)| Radical reformer Boris N. Yeltsin (NNP)] election , Yeltsin walked through the Kremlin grounds with reporters and well-wishers 
After passing through the Spassky Gate , [he (PRP)| Spassky Gate (NNP)] was joined by more supporters 
Thank [you (PRP)| Mikhail S. Gorbachev (NNP)] ! 
Thank [you (PRP)| Mikhail S. Gorbachev (NNP)] for [our (PRP$)| more supporters (NNS)] future ! 
one man shouted 
Yeltsin mounted the steps of an embankment below the Kremlin wall for an impromptu speech to supporters who rushed across the cobblestone street 
To shouts of victory ! 
Yeltsin pledged to work for a renewed Russia 
The crowd pledged support 
[We (PRP)| Radical reformer Boris N. Yeltsin (NNP)] are prepared to go together with him into tough times 
Everyone says that , one crowd member , Nadezda Matveyeva said 
During [his (PRP$)| one crowd member (NN)] campaign , Yeltsin called on the Congress to reject the Kremlin's new program for gradually transforming the country's crippled , centrally planned economy to a partial market economy 
The Congress must take the citizens of Russia under [its (PRP$)| the 1,060-member Russian Congress of People's Deputies (NNP)] defense , [he (PRP)| one crowd member (NN)] said 
The reform program , which would triple the price of bread on July 1 and double the cost of other foodstuffs starting Jan. 1 , caused panic buying that prompted Moscow city authorities to bar sales to non-residents of the capital 
Gorbachev , who left Moscow today for a Washington summit , went on national television Sunday night to try to calm fears 
But anxiety is high and the list of items being rationed is on the rise 
Yeltsin has broadly outlined a plan that would more rapidly seek a transition to a market-based economy , giving more freedom to enterprises and entrepreneurs 
Lawmakers said Monday [they (PRP)| fellow lawmakers (NNS)] believed Yeltsin's offer of a coalition government in the republic bolstered [his (PRP$)| Radical reformer Boris N. Yeltsin (NNP)] chances to win today's round 
Discontent over the government's economic program also boosted Yeltsin's campaign , said one of his backers , lawmaker Leonid Gurevich of Murmansk 
Some economists have estimated that up to 40 million people could lose [their (PRP$)| up to 40 million people (NNS)] jobs as a result of the central government's reforms , expected to drive many inefficient businesses into bankruptcy 
Under the three-step reform plan , to be implemented through 1995 , 60 percent of state enterprises would be sold to the public sector , and controls would be lifted on 60 percent of prices
