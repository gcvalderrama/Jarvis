Boris N. Yeltsin , the new president of the Russian Federation and a leading critic of Mikhail S. Gorbachev , said Thursday [he (PRP)| Boris N. Yeltsin (NNP)] will try to make peace in [his (PRP$)| Boris N. Yeltsin (NNP)] personal feud with the Soviet president 
Yeltsin , a radical reformer , was quoted by the official Tass news agency as saying [he (PRP)| Boris N. Yeltsin (NNP)] would put aside personal differences with Gorbachev when the president returns from the Washington summit 
Yeltsin was seeking to calm the fears of the deputies of the republic's Congress about [his (PRP$)| Boris N. Yeltsin (NNP)] stormy relationship with Gorbachev , [his (PRP$)| Boris N. Yeltsin (NNP)] former mentor 
In [his (PRP$)| Boris N. Yeltsin (NNP)] new position as president of Russia , the largest Soviet republic , Yeltsin has a formidable platform from which to challenge and criticize Gorbachev , who opposed his election 
Deputies speaking Thursday at the Russian Congress expressed concern over the exchange of statements about each other by Yeltsin and Gorbachev , Tass reported 
Yeltsin answered that after Gorbachev returns June 4 from the summit in Washington , [I (PRP)| Boris N. Yeltsin (NNP)] think [we (PRP)| Deputies speaking Thursday at the Russian Congress (NNPS)] will have an appropriate conversation , and [we (PRP)| Deputies speaking Thursday at the Russian Congress (NNPS)] will resolve most issues without damaging the sovereignty and aims of Russia , Tass said 
At a news conference Wednesday , Yeltsin called for achieving Russian sovereignty within 100 days 
The term is used here to mean not independence , but autonomy in most internal decisions 
Yeltsin also urged the Kremlin to allow the other 14 republics to enjoy the same autonomy , making the country a federation of states that could overrule the central government on most matters 
Although Yeltsin said [he (PRP)| Boris N. Yeltsin (NNP)] wanted a businesslike relationship with Gorbachev , [he (PRP)| Boris N. Yeltsin (NNP)] also made an oblique call Thursday for Gorbachev to give up one of his posts : either Soviet president or Communist Party general secretary 
[I (PRP)| Boris N. Yeltsin (NNP)] am against combining any post in one person 
And [I (PRP)| Boris N. Yeltsin (NNP)] am talking not just about the chairmanship of the party at the Russian level , at the regional level , or at the local level , [he (PRP)| Boris N. Yeltsin (NNP)] said 
In Ottawa on Tuesday , Gorbachev said [he (PRP)| Mikhail S. Gorbachev (NNP)] was somewhat concerned about Yeltsin's victory and feared that if Yeltsin is playing a political game , then [we (PRP)| Boris N. Yeltsin (NNP)] may be in for a difficult time 
There have been no reports that Gorbachev sent congratulations to Yeltsin on [his (PRP$)| Mikhail S. Gorbachev (NNP)] election 
Gorbachev brought Yeltsin to Moscow to head the city's Communist Party but fired [him (PRP)| Mikhail S. Gorbachev (NNP)] in 1987 after Yeltsin publicly criticized the pace of reform 
Relations have been strained ever since 
Yeltsin capped a remarkable political comeback by winning election Tuesday as Russian president 
However , at Thursday's session of the Russian Congress , Deputy Ivan Galushko from the Jewish autonomous region in the Soviet Far East said Yeltsin was overstepping [his (PRP$)| Boris N. Yeltsin (NNP)] authority with some of [his (PRP$)| Boris N. Yeltsin (NNP)] statements the day before 
[He (PRP)| Deputy Ivan Galushko from the Jewish autonomous region in the Soviet Far East (NNP)] called on Yeltsin to refrain from hasty statements on questions that are within the competence of the Congress or Supreme Soviet 
Tass said many deputies seconded Galushko's opinion 
In [his (PRP$)| Deputy Ivan Galushko from the Jewish autonomous region in the Soviet Far East (NNP)] reply , Yeltsin acknowledged disagreements with Gorbachev but said [he (PRP)| Deputy Ivan Galushko from the Jewish autonomous region in the Soviet Far East (NNP)] would put [them (PRP)| many deputies (NNS)] aside 
True , [we (PRP)| many deputies (NNS)] have [our (PRP$)| many deputies (NNS)] differences , said Yeltsin 
[I (PRP)| Boris N. Yeltsin (NNP)] renounce all these personal aspects fully and completely 
[I (PRP)| Boris N. Yeltsin (NNP)] leave that behind 
A deputy of the national Supreme Soviet legislature , Anatoly Denisov , said in an interview that the differences between Yeltsin and Gorbachev are so pronounced [they (PRP)| Supreme Soviet (NNP)] portend very bad consequences and difficult conflicts for the nation 
[He (PRP)| A deputy of the national Supreme Soviet legislature , Anatoly Denisov (NN)] said [they (PRP)| Supreme Soviet (NNP)] could lead to the imposition of Soviet presidential rule nationwide
