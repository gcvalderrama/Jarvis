A predawn earthquake in Soviet Central Asia unleashed a 50-foot-high wall of dirt and mud that buried a mountain village and swept through at least two others Monday , killing up to 1,000 people as [they (PRP)| 1,000 people (NNS)] slept , officials said 
The devastating earthquake in the republic of Tadzhikistan was the second to strike the Soviet Union in two months 
Almost everybody died , Zainiddin Nasreddinov , editor-in-chief of Tadzhikistan's official news agency , said by telephone after visiting the wrecked farming settlement of Sharora 
[He (PRP)| Almost everybody (NN)] estimated the number of dead there alone at 600 
Sharora had more than 150 peasant households before that tragic moment , the Soviet news agency Tass reported 
Now most of [it (PRP)| Sharora (NNP)] is razed to the ground by the ruthless force of the natural calamity 
Tass said the number of dead in the disaster zone 1,800 miles southeast of Moscow was estimated at 1,000 , but cautioned that was a preliminary figure 
Rescue work is being continued and distant mountain villages have not been checked yet , Tass said 
Damaged roads were hampering those efforts 
The quake struck the southwestern part of Tadzhikistan , a Soviet republic of more than 4.8 million people that borders Afghanistan and China 
The 40-second tremor , at 5:02 a.m. (6:02 p.m. EST Sunday )was centered about 20 to 30 miles southwest of Tadzhikistan's capital of Dushanbe , a city of more than 460,000 people , in the fertile Gissar district , a center of grapegrowing and livestock-raising , Tass said 
An official at Dushanbe's seismic center said the quake was strong enough to knock things off shelves in tall apartment buildings in the city , but that [it (PRP)| The quake (NN)] caused no known damage or injuries there 
[He (PRP)| An official at Dushanbe's seismic center (NN)] declined to give [his (PRP$)| An official at Dushanbe's seismic center (NN)] name 
The U.S. Geological Survey in Reston , Va. , estimated the quake at 5.4 on the Richter scale , which measures ground motion as recorded on a seismograph 
The Dec. 7 earthquake in northwestern Armenia , 1,300 miles west of Dushanbe , registered a 6.9 on the Richter scale and killed 25,000 people 
The earthquake unhinged a wall of sodden dirt and mud at least five miles wide that buried the village of Okuli-Bolo and much of Sharora , said Erkin Kasimov , an official of Tadzhikistan's Foreign Ministry 
Almost all of the victims died asleep in their beds , Police Maj. Alexander Loparev , duty officer at Tadzhikistan Interior Ministry headquarters in Dushanbe said by telephone 
Residents of another village , Okuli-Poyen , apparently roused in time , fled in panic before the mudslide , which traveled 1 \ to 1 -LCB- miles , could reach [their (PRP$)| Residents of another village (NNS)] homes , Kasimov said from Dushanbe 
Officials and Soviet media said the devastation was vast , and total in places 
In Okuli-Bolo and Okuli-Poyen , near the epicenter , everything is destroyed _ all the homes , the schools , the hospitals and clinics , the stores , Nasreddinov said 
Okuli-Bolo is a heap of rubble and the chairman of a local economic cooperative , Hairrulo Yuldashev , said the households of 70 peasant families were completely demolished and buried by the landslide , Tass said 
More than 70 villagers were buried by the landslide , it said 
In Sharora , cries and wails can be heard everwhere , Tass reported 
Some are bemoaning and burying their near and dear ones , while others are trying to find the few survivors between the thick layer of sand and clay 
It said all of the village's streets had been buried under the 50-foot-high layer of earth that the earthquake detached from a hill near the village 
The TV news program Vremya showed aerial footage of Sharora , with white roofs of buried homes peeking through the dirt like seashells scattered on a beach 
Kasimov said that according to preliminary figures , the quake and landslide destroyed about 100 buildings , including five schools and a maternity hospital near the epicenter 
The hospital was evacuated of mothers and newborns before the wall of mud arrived and there were no victims , [he (PRP)| Erkin Kasimov (NNP)] said 
There was no exact count available for the population of the stricken villages 
But the official at the Dushanbe seismic center said families are traditionally large in the mostly Moslem republic , and that one dwelling often houses eight to 10 people 
The quake and landslide downed three miles of power lines , destroyed nine miles of telephone lines and inundated four miles of a navigation canal with mud , Kasimov said 
Thousands of head of publicly owned cattle have perished , Tass said 
[It (PRP)| the Soviet news agency Tass (NNP)] said thousands of acres of fertile farmland were covered by a thick layer of sand and clay 
Nasreddinov said the buildings destroyed were one-story brick structures 
Soldiers went to the villages to keep order and restore communications , electricity and water , [he (PRP)| Zainiddin Nasreddinov (NNP)] said 
Kasimov said geologists believed water from mountain springs had accumulated under the soil of the hills in the Gissar region , making [them (PRP)| geologists believed water from mountain springs (NNS)] prone to mudslides 
When the earthquake came , [it (PRP)| The Dec. 7 earthquake in northwestern Armenia (NN)] was like a catapult , and [it (PRP)| The Dec. 7 earthquake in northwestern Armenia (NN)] hurled the sodden earth onto the villages below , Kasimov said 
Tass said bulldozers , cranes and excavators had been rushed to the quake zone to help dig for survivors , and that volunteers had come from Dushanbe and other nearby areas to help in rescue and relief 
Equipment , food and fuel were also sent to the scene , Tass said 
On Vremya , a statement of condolences from the Kremlin leadership was read , and aid promised from the national government 
According to Nasreddinov , President Mikhail S. Gorbachev telephoned Tadzhikistan officials to promise Moscow's help 
In Washington , U.S. State Department spokesman Charles Redman said [he (PRP)| U.S. State Department spokesman Charles Redman (NNP)] knew of no request for assistance from the Soviets 
[Our (PRP$)| Tadzhikistan officials (NNS)] sympathy certainly goes out again to the victims of this most recent earthquake , [he (PRP)| U.S. State Department spokesman Charles Redman (NNP)] said 
The experience of the Armenian earthquake shows the death toll in Tadzhikistan could be much higher than the first estimates 
Soviet officials , including Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnaze , initially spoke of thousands of victims in the Armenian quake 
Kremlin spokesmen later estimated 55,000 people had been killed , but on Dec. 29 , Armenian officials gave what [they (PRP)| Armenian officials (NNS)] called an accurate death toll of 25,000
