The news from Iraq is bad 
After the brilliant military victory , a colossal human tragedy is emerging that is bringing the U.S. to the edge of a political defeat 
For [it (PRP)| the brilliant military victory (NN)] is the human dimension , we all know , that shapes the verdict of history 
But do not despair ; the great victory in the Gulf war now looking so tattered and tarnished can yet be saved 
The dynamics of the situation will soon force a change 
Within days , the United Nations will be compelled to implement a massive intervention in Iraq's internal affairs , under the term of [its (PRP$)| a massive intervention in Iraq's internal affairs (NN)] cease-fire 
If the U.N. fails , it will become irrelevant as the League of Nations did in the 1930s 
As day follows night , the U.N. will thus move into ever expanding confrontations and conflicts with Saddam Hussein and [his (PRP$)| Saddam Hussein (NNP)] remaining military forces 
Either Saddam Hussein will win by destroying the credibility and influence of the U.N. , or [he (PRP)| Saddam Hussein (NNP)] will finally make [his (PRP$)| Saddam Hussein (NNP)] last mistake 
Between the invasion of Kuwait last August and the end of the Gulf war , many brave souls inside and outside the U.S. government worried about clever stratagems that Saddam Hussein might employ to defeat the U.S. 
What if he split the coalition by making enticing offers ? 
What if he dragged Israel into the war ? 
What if he inflicted heavy casualties ? 
What if he suddenly withdrew from Kuwait to save his huge army and then built nuclear weapons as Lenin saved [his (PRP$)| Lenin (NNP)] Bolshevik regime by surrendering a third of Russia to the Germans in the Brest-Litovsk treaty ? 
Well , Saddam Hussein may be twice as brutal as Lenin , but [he (PRP)| Saddam Hussein (NNP)] is only one-tenth as smart 
George Bush , by contrast , developed a coherent strategy to liberate Kuwait ; backed up [his (PRP$)| George Bush (NNP)] diplomacy with a war plan that provided for sufficient force to achieve a clear military objective ; obtained at every step the endorsement not only of America's allies but miraculously also of the U.N. Security Council ; secured public support at home and the consent of a divided , reluctant Congress ; wisely left military campaigns and tactics to [his (PRP$)| George Bush (NNP)] commanders ; and fended off a last minute attempt by Mikhail Gorbachev to turn Iraq into a Soviet protectorate 
Now , for the coming final round in Bush vs. Saddam , [I (PRP)| Bush vs. Saddam (NNP)] certainly would not place [my (PRP$)| Bush vs. Saddam (NNP)] bets on the half-witted Butcher of Baghdad 
To be sure , many critics now fear President Bush has walked away from this final round , leaving Iraq a vast disaster area , like an abandoned Chernobyl reactor , and condemning Kurds and Shiites to choose between permanent refugee camps , prison or death 
Even if the president wanted to , [he (PRP)| the president (NN)] could not walk away from Iraq's internal affairs 
Not without destroying the U.N. , and thus destroying any chance of success for [his (PRP$)| the president (NN)] Middle East peace diplomacy ; not without inscribing [his (PRP$)| the president (NN)] Gulf war on the same tablet as Woodrow Wilson's League of Nations and Lyndon Johnson's war in Vietnam 
Saddam Hussein will , of course , try to turn America's victory into a Pyrrhic one 
In an hour-long speech on March 16 , [he (PRP)| Saddam Hussein (NNP)] praised political pluralism , democracy and Iraq's future contribution to stability in the Middle East 
[He (PRP)| Saddam Hussein (NNP)] was appealing , [it (PRP)| an hour-long speech on March 16 (NN)] seems , to Washington's interest in some balance among Iran , Iraq and Syria ; to Ankara's concern about turmoil on Turkey's southern border ; and perhaps to friendly German arms merchants who would again want to do business with [him (PRP)| Saddam Hussein (NNP)] 
But then [he (PRP)| Saddam Hussein (NNP)] hurled at [his (PRP$)| Saddam Hussein (NNP)] neighbors and at the world at large acts of mass cruelty that compelled Ankara and London , Tehran and Paris , Bonn and yes Washington , to recognize that one's own moral integrity is more important than Iraq's territorial integrity 
Even though the Bush administration's response to the new challenge has been mysteriously slow and inept , Saddam Hussein's most recent depredations have killed [his (PRP$)| George Bush (NNP)] last chance to plead for magnanimity in victory , or to posture [himself as the lesser evil , who would , at least , give us the blessings of stability in Iraq (PRP)| George Bush (NNP)] 
[He (PRP)| George Bush (NNP)] also prevented [his (PRP$)| George Bush (NNP)] few remaining supporters in the U.N. from diluting the tough cease-fire terms 
Now the U.N. is committed to implementing the destruction of all of Iraq's chemical and biological weapons , longer-range ballistic missiles , and nuclear materials and components 
And once Iraq is permitted to resume oil exports , [it (PRP)| Iraq (NNP)] must contribute part of [its (PRP$)| Iraq (NNP)] earnings to a U.N.-administered fund for reparations to Kuwait and other victims of [its (PRP$)| Iraq (NNP)] aggression 
It is most implausible that Saddam Hussein could survive as Iraq's dictator and comply with these terms 
To become a law-abiding ward of the U.N. is too alien to [his (PRP$)| Saddam Hussein (NNP)] mindset , too contrary to the thuggery that [his (PRP$)| Saddam Hussein (NNP)] henchmen are forced to practice 
When Saddam Hussein is told to hand to the U.N. a list of all [his (PRP$)| Saddam Hussein (NNP)] prohibited weapons as a first step in complying with the ceasefire , [he (PRP)| Saddam Hussein (NNP)] might well respond by arguing : (1 )Iraq never had any of these weapons , (2 )if it had , American bombing raids have destroyed every one of them , and (3 )if there were remaining weapons , all records have been burned by Kurdish terrorists 
But [he (PRP)| Saddam Hussein (NNP)] will not refrain from using more brutal ways as well to obstruct the implementation of the U.N. directives 
We should expect unexplained disappearances of U.N. arms control inspectors , crashes (blamed on Kurds )of U.N. helicopters looking for hidden chemical weapons , and the killing of thousands of Iraqi soldiers , scientists and technicians who might reveal the location of prohibited weaponry 
Saddam Hussein may not realize [it (PRP)| the U.N. (NNP)] , but as [he (PRP)| Saddam Hussein (NNP)] begins to obstruct , violate and sabotage the U.N. implementation of the ceasefire agreement , [he (PRP)| Saddam Hussein (NNP)] must take on not just some bureaucrats at U.N. headquarters and the U.N. flag 
[He (PRP)| Saddam Hussein (NNP)] must take on George Bush and Old Glory 
Since Mr. Bush has just succeeded in turning the U.N. into a useful instrument for enhancing world order , [he (PRP)| George Bush (NNP)] ca not let Saddam Hussein steal his success 
Moreover , the president will depend on the U.N. to put an end to the Arab-Israeli conflict , a key policy goal he announced after Desert Storm 
Nearly all suggestions for the Arab-Israeli conflict call for territorial concessions by Israel in exchange for internationally guaranteed security arrangements the territory for peace principle to which the president referred 
How could the U.S. ever help to promote such a deal if [it (PRP)| such a deal (NN)] permitted Iraq to violate the U.N. cease-fire terms ? 
Since the U.S. achieved total military dominance over the Iraqi forces and now plays a leading role in the U.N. , the conditions for enforcing U.N. prohibitions on armaments are optimal 
If international security guarantees were to fail in this instance , the deal that could be offered to Israel would no longer be territory for peace , but territory for a worthless U.N. document 
Senior administration officials are saying that the Desert Storm victory opened a window of opportunity for U.S. peace efforts in the Arab-Israeli conflict 
For this to be true , Saddam Hussein must not be allowed to slam the window shut 
Five weeks ago , in [his (PRP$)| Saddam Hussein (NNP)] triumphant speech to Congress , President Bush said that our commitment to peace in the Middle East does not end with the liberation of Kuwait 
Indeed , [it (PRP)| Five weeks (NNS)] does not 
The U.S. is committed to support the U.N. , and the U.N. is now committed to inserting [itself (PRP)| the U.N. (NNP)] deeply into the internal affairs of Iraq 
The success or failure of this endeavor will largely determine the prospects for peace in the Middle East 
[It (PRP)| this endeavor (NN)] will also determine the final winner in the contest between George Bush and Saddam Hussein
