President Bush today renewed [his (PRP$)| President Bush (NNP)] threat to veto legislation raising the minimum wage beyond $ 4.25 an hour as Senate Democrats moved to quickly pass a bill raising the wage floor to $ 4.55 
House Minority Leader Bob Michel , R-Ill. , who met with Bush and relayed [his (PRP$)| President Bush (NNP)] comments to reporters , said the president made [it (PRP)| House (NNP)] abundantly clear there will be absolutely no flexibility , not one penny , not one deviation from [his (PRP$)| the president (NN)] position on the minimum wage 
Bush met with Republican congressional leaders hours before the Senate opened debate on the legislation 
The Senate bill , sponsored by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy , D-Mass. , would raise the hourly minimum from $ 3.35 to $ 4.65 by January 1992 and contains no provision allowing a lower wage for new workers 
But Kennedy aides said [he (PRP)| Edward M. Kennedy (NNP)] would offer an amendment making [his (PRP$)| Edward M. Kennedy (NNP)] measure identical to the House bill passed two weeks ago , which has a final wage of $ 4.55 and would allow employers to pay new entrants in the job market a sub-minimum for two months 
Bush has insisted that employers be allowed to pay any new employees a sub-minimum training wage for six months 
The GOP leaders who met with Bush said [he (PRP)| President Bush (NNP)] also reiterated [his (PRP$)| President Bush (NNP)] opposition to shortening that time frame 
Another of the Republicans with whom Bush met , Sen. Thad Cochran , R-Miss. , told reporters afterward that the message that was given to the president by the Senate (GOP )leadership was that we are going to stand with [him (PRP)| the president (NN)] on the minimum wage issue 
And we urged [him (PRP)| the Republicans (NNPS)] not to back down from [his (PRP$)| the Republicans (NNPS)] commitment to $ 4.25 and the six-month training wage 
Republicans could thwart the Democratsquick-passage strategy by staging a filibuster , but an aide to one leading GOP senator said there were no plans to do that 
The aide said [it (PRP)| the Democratsquick-passage strategy (NN)] appeared the Democrats had the votes to win passage of [their (PRP$)| the Democrats(NNPS)] plan by early next week 
Meanwhile , a new poll said there was overwhelming public support for an increase in the minimum wage , which has been at $ 3.35 since 1981 
The Washington Post@ABC News survey , conducted March 30 through April 3 , said 84 percent of respondents backed an increase while 14 percent did not 
Eighty-two percent said [they (PRP)| respondents (NNS)] favored an increase even if [it (PRP)| an increase (NN)] would trigger higher consumer prices 
But only about half of the 84 percent who initially favored a higher minimum wage said [they (PRP)| respondents (NNS)] would hold to that opinion even if [it (PRP)| that opinion (NN)] meant businesses would stop hiring , or would fire , workers because of added payroll costs caused by a higher minimum wage 
The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points 
By agreeing to amend his bill , Kennedy , provided the amended version wins passage , averts the need for a conference committee to resolve differences between the House and Senate versions 
A number of other amendments were also expected , including a GOP attempt to substitute Bush's proposal 
A lobbyist in favor of raising the minimum wage said Bush's repeated veto threats had all but quashed any hopes by Democratic sponsors of avoiding a showdown with the president 
[He (PRP)| A lobbyist in favor of raising the minimum wage (NN)] says [he (PRP)| A lobbyist in favor of raising the minimum wage (NN)] wo not compromise so [I (PRP)| AFL-CIO lobbyist Robert McGlotten (NNP)] do not see a need for [us (PRP)| Democratic sponsors of avoiding a showdown with the president (NNS)] to do anything except send [him (PRP)| A lobbyist in favor of raising the minimum wage (NN)] [our (PRP$)| Democratic sponsors of avoiding a showdown with the president (NNS)] bill , said AFL-CIO lobbyist Robert McGlotten 
Bush has been adamant in saying [he (PRP)| President Bush (NNP)] would veto the House-passed bill and appears to have the votes to sustain a veto in both chambers of Congress 
While the House-passed bill cuts the final target of the hourly minimum wage to $ 4.55 , [it (PRP)| their first job _ at $ 3.35 effective Oct. 1 (NN)] moves up the effective dates of the three increases from Jan. 1 to Oct. 1 _ meaning the first increase would come this year and the last jump would occur Oct. 1 , 1992 
Bush has proposed three 30-cent increases in the minimum wage beginning Jan. 1 , 1990 , and ending two years later with the hourly minimum at $ 4.25 
The president said [his (PRP$)| the president (NN)] support for those increases hinges on a provision allowing employers to pay new workers a sub-minimum wage for six months regardless of any past experience with another employer 
The sub-minimum , under the Bush plan , would be $ 3.35 an hour after the first increase in the minimum wage 
It would rise to $ 3.40 an hour by 1992 
The House-passed bill sets the wage for new hires _ provided [it (PRP)| their first job _ at $ 3.35 effective Oct. 1 (NN)] is their first job _ at $ 3.35 effective Oct. 1 
When the subsequent increases in the minimum wage took effect the sub-minimum would rise as well , to 85 percent of the minimum 
The provision allowing the new-hire wage would expire on Sept. 30 , 1992
