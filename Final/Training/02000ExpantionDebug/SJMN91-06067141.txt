The world reacted with sickened shock and outrage to the brutal beating of a Southern California man by police officers , played out in painful clarity on the screens of tens of millions of television sets this week from an amateur cameraman's videotape. ; Some in the African-American community here reacted with more of a shrug 
You talk to people in the black community here , and [they (PRP)| black people (NNS)] say , This is not news , said Joe Hicks , an American Civil Liberties Union spokesman who grew up in the community 
[They (PRP)| black people (NNS)] say , Why are all the white people so surprised ? 
A guy got his butt beat by the cops 
[It (PRP)| his butt beat (NN)] happens all the time 
; Behind the shrug , though , emotions run deep 
There is nothing [you (PRP)| spokesman who grew up in the community (NN)] can imagine the guy had done that would justify that kind of response , Hicks said. ; Rodney Glen King , the victim of the beating , on Wednesday was released from Los Angeles County Jail after prosecutors said police had failed to prove [their (PRP$)| prosecutors (NNS)] charges that [he (PRP)| spokesman who grew up in the community (NN)] resisted arrest after a high-speed chase 
The officers involved in the beating have been taken off patrol. ; King told reporters that there had been no chase , that [he (PRP)| Rodney Glen King (NNP)] had done nothing to provoke the attack and that [he (PRP)| Rodney Glen King (NNP)] was scared for [my (PRP$)| Rodney Glen King (NNP)] life during the beating. ; [They (PRP)| The officers involved in the beating (NNS)] continued to pound on [me (PRP)| Rodney Glen King (NNP)] and beat on [me (PRP)| Rodney Glen King (NNP)] , King said from a wheelchair , all over my body ... all over [my (PRP$)| Rodney Glen King (NNP)] body 
[My (PRP$)| Rodney Glen King (NNP)] ankles 
[They (PRP)| The officers involved in the beating (NNS)] beat where [it (PRP)| the brutal beating of a Southern California man (NN)] hurt 
[They (PRP)| The officers involved in the beating (NNS)] beat my whole body where [it (PRP)| my whole body (NN)] hurt 
; Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates , long controversial for racial statements he has made , called the brutality depicted on the tape an aberration 
; Anyone who viewed this tape would hasten to make a quick judgment , Gates said Tuesday 
[I (PRP)| Daryl Gates (NNP)] would hope the public on this one case not make a judgment on the Los Angeles Police Department 
; The department issued no statements Wednesday 
Agencies including the FBI , the LAPD , Los Angeles District Attorney's Office and the California Highway Patrol are investigating the beating 
A city councilman also has asked for a council committee review of the larger issue of police brutality throughout the city. ; The stunning videotape was recorded by George Holliday , a plumber who was awakened about 12:30 a.m. Sunday in [his (PRP$)| George Holliday (NNP)] suburban Los Angeles home by the sound of police helicopters overhead 
Holliday went to the terrace of [his (PRP$)| George Holliday (NNP)] second-story apartment and , seeing police in the street below , decided to get some practice with [his (PRP$)| George Holliday (NNP)] new videotape recorder. ; Holliday took the tape to a local television station , which aired [it (PRP)| the tape an aberration (NN)] Monday night and passed [it (PRP)| the tape an aberration (NN)] along to the Cable News Network 
By Tuesday night , the horrifying images had been piped into more than 30 million homes : There , the 25-year-old King was lying on the ground , struggling to [his (PRP$)| George Holliday (NNP)] hands and knees , then writhing on the ground under a hail of police night sticks and kicks 
Witnesses said police also used a stun gun on King 
Three or four officers had at King in the two-minute tape , while as many as seven others stood by to watch. ; King is black 
The races of the police officers involved have not been revealed 
King said [he (PRP)| Rodney Glen King (NNP)] did not hear any racial comments from the officers. ; [They (PRP)| the police officers involved (NNS)] beat [me (PRP)| Rodney Glen King (NNP)] so bad [I (PRP)| Rodney Glen King (NNP)] did not pay attention to what [they (PRP)| the police officers involved (NNS)] were saying , [he (PRP)| Rodney Glen King (NNP)] said , adding that police in Los Angeles consider [themselves (PRP)| Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates (NNP)] different than the general public. ; King , who had been released from jail in December after serving 2Â 1/2 years on a second-degree robbery conviction , had been pursued to the spot outside Holliday's apartment by CHP and Los Angeles officers in a chase police said reached speeds over 110 mph 
Before his release Wednesday , the father of two reportedly lay in the county jail's hospital ward with a broken jaw , broken leg , disfigured face and badly bruised body. ; When [I (PRP)| Rodney Glen King (NNP)] saw [it (PRP)| his release (NN)] on TV , [I (PRP)| Rodney Glen King (NNP)] thought , Is this something happening in South Africa or Kuwait ? 
said Keith Huling , 35 , who lives in the same apartment complex as Holliday 
Then [I (PRP)| Keith Huling (NNP)] looked a little closer , and said , Hey , that is the park across the street 
; Police have said King resisted arrest 
Witnesses have said [he (PRP)| Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates (NNP)] did not. ; Huling said [he (PRP)| Keith Huling (NNP)] knows of other police beatings that [he (PRP)| Keith Huling (NNP)] believes are racially motivated 
A prevailing sense in [his (PRP$)| Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates (NNP)] neighborhood this week , [he (PRP)| Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates (NNP)] said , is that if [I (PRP)| Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates (NNP)] come home from work and make a turn on a red light , [I (PRP)| Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates (NNP)] am going to get [my (PRP$)| Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates (NNP)] butt kicked 
; The perception that non-Anglos are the targets of police brutality has been chronic here. ; Whether that is a perception or a reality is almost beside the point , because the perception is the reality , said Zev Yaroslavsky , the councilman who has requested public hearings on brutality throughout the city 
[I (PRP)| Zev Yaroslavsky (NNP)] am troubled by the fact that when [I (PRP)| Zev Yaroslavsky (NNP)] learned the person beaten was black , [I (PRP)| Zev Yaroslavsky (NNP)] was not surprised ... 
It is rare that there is an Anglo that gets the crap beat out of [him (PRP)| the person beaten (NN)] with a billy club 
; Yaroslavsky pointed to recent incidents of harassment of black people 
Just last December , businessman and former Laker Jamaal Wilkes was handcuffed during a routine traffic stop 
The police department's subsequent apology to [him (PRP)| former Laker Jamaal Wilkes (NNP)] came on the heels of a federal jury award of $ 540,000 to former major league baseball player Joe Morgan , who said Los Angeles police in 1988 had grabbed [him (PRP)| Los Angeles police in 1988 (NN)] by the neck , thrown [him (PRP)| former Laker Jamaal Wilkes (NNP)] to the ground and cuffed [him (PRP)| former Laker Jamaal Wilkes (NNP)] at Los Angeles International Airport when [they (PRP)| businessman and former Laker Jamaal Wilkes (NN)] thought [he (PRP)| former Laker Jamaal Wilkes (NNP)] was a drug courier. ; Last year , 55 residents of one of the city's streets accepted a $ 3 million settlement for damages from a 1988 police drug raid in which officers allegedly wrecked apartments and beat several people. ; [I (PRP)| Zev Yaroslavsky (NNP)] do not think the body politic in Los Angeles has been willing to address [it (PRP)| Los Angeles County Jail (NN)] , Yaroslavsky said 
But what the public has seen in black and white , no pun intended , leaves nothing to the imagination , leaves nothing to interpretation , (and )probably is the one event that may sensitize the politicians. ; The Police Misconduct Lawyer Referral Service so far this year has received 531 complaints of police misconduct , including 127 involving officers in the LAPD , according to Karol Heppe , the non-profit organization's executive director 
The total number of complaints is 75 percent higher than [it (PRP)| The total number of complaints (NN)] was at this time last year , Heppe said. ; The complaints range from illegal search and seizure to verbal abuse to death , Heppe said 
Most do not lead to prosecution. ; The only difference between those and this one is that this one was caught on videotape , she said. ; Heppe lamented that the Los Angeles police chief's attitude does not enhance the department's reputation 
Among the racial controversies [he (PRP)| Karol Heppe (NNP)] has stirred was the suggestion that blacks die in choke holds because [they (PRP)| blacks (NNS)] have abnormal necks. ; The ACLU's Hicks said the organization plans today to ask for Gatesresignation
