The nation's top military officer jumped into the Pentagon budget battle Friday , arguing that hasty cuts in military spending will end up breaking the back of America's defense 
If [you suddenly cash in your insurance policy (PRP)| The nation's top military officer (NN)] to buy a so-called peace dividend , you will get neither , Gen. Colin Powell , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , said in a speech to the National Press Club 
As we get smaller , we also need to get better 
If we do it too fast , we do not get better _ we get hollow , [he (PRP)| The nation's top military officer (NN)] said , warning against a return to the post-Vietnam War and World War II reductions 
Powell's blunt remarks were [his (PRP$)| Colin Powell (NNP)] first major commentary on the debate over spending for the nation's military arsenal at a time of lessened East-West tensions 
A former national security adviser , Powell now serves as the president's primary military counselor and coordinator of the nationsmilitary leaders 
Powell said that even though the Berlin Wall has fallen and the Warsaw Pact has nearly evaporated , [he (PRP)| Colin Powell (NNP)] has had to place the American military in dangerous situations during [his (PRP$)| Colin Powell (NNP)] brief stint in office 
[I (PRP)| Colin Powell (NNP)] have been reminded again and again since becoming chairman that this is still a dangerous world and that [you (PRP)| The nation's top military officer (NN)] would better be able to respond if someone challenges [your (PRP$)| The nation's top military officer (NN)] interests , [he (PRP)| Colin Powell (NNP)] said , citing Panama , the Philippines , the Persian Gulf , Europe and Korea as examples 
Powell said that despite changes in the Soviet Union , the Soviets still have the ability to destroy the United States with nuclear weapons 
We must not confuse a decline in defense spending with a decline in the nation's enduring defense needs to deal with the enduring realities we face , Powell said 
The four-star general said that although Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev remains very much in charge , [his (PRP$)| The four-star general (NN)] policies are sowing the seed of [his (PRP$)| Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev (NNP)] own weakness 
The Soviet Union will remain a superpower well into the next century , Powell said 
So even as we reduce , we must maintain our ability to deter and defend , [he (PRP)| Colin Powell (NNP)] said 
Powell said Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's plan released earlier this week to cut military forces by 25 percent over five years shows we are willing to examine any reasonable proposal 
But the general also defended President Bush's $ 303.3 billion spending plan for fiscal 1991 as a realistic , prudent response to the changing world 
The administration budget blueprint , Powell said , will begin to reduce the nation's forces over time 
On this glide path we will reach a base force which [I (PRP)| Colin Powell (NNP)] believe is not prudent to go below if we wish to match enduring defense needs with enduring realities , Powell said 
We know we will get smaller 
That is inevitable , that is the correct thing to do , Powell said 
But if Bush's budget request is cut back significantly , [You (PRP)| Colin Powell (NNP)] will force us to start breaking the back of our armed forces , [he (PRP)| President Bush's (NNP)] said 
The general also took aim at lawmakers who are seeking more severe cuts over a shorter period of time 
Although [he (PRP)| The four-star general (NN)] named no names , House Armed Services Chairman Les Aspin , D-Wis. , has been sharply critical of Cheney's 25 percent plan , and Senate Armed Services Chairman Sam Nunn , D-Ga. , has complained about strategic blanks in Cheney's budget 
[We (PRP)| lawmakers who are seeking more severe cuts over a shorter period of time (NNS)] are looking ahead with [our (PRP$)| lawmakers who are seeking more severe cuts over a shorter period of time (NNS)] eyes open 
[We (PRP)| lawmakers who are seeking more severe cuts over a shorter period of time (NNS)] are cutting programs 
[We (PRP)| lawmakers who are seeking more severe cuts over a shorter period of time (NNS)] want to close bases 
[We (PRP)| lawmakers who are seeking more severe cuts over a shorter period of time (NNS)] have frozen construction and hiring 
[We (PRP)| lawmakers who are seeking more severe cuts over a shorter period of time (NNS)] are cutting troops , and believe it or not _ [we (PRP)| lawmakers who are seeking more severe cuts over a shorter period of time (NNS)] are cutting generals , Powell said 
What [we (PRP)| lawmakers who are seeking more severe cuts over a shorter period of time (NNS)] need are not more insights on how to trim the margins , what [we (PRP)| lawmakers who are seeking more severe cuts over a shorter period of time (NNS)] need is breathing space 
[We (PRP)| lawmakers who are seeking more severe cuts over a shorter period of time (NNS)] need to time to make the plans work , Powell said
