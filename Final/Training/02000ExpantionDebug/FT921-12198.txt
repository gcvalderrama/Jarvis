GOVERNOR Bill Clinton of Arkansas was gambling yesterday that an extraordinary prime-time television confession of wrongdoing in his marriage has salvaged [his (PRP$)| GOVERNOR Bill Clinton of Arkansas (NNP)] campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination 
During a joint TV appearance with [his (PRP$)| GOVERNOR Bill Clinton of Arkansas (NNP)] wife , Hillary , Mr Clinton admitted [his (PRP$)| GOVERNOR Bill Clinton of Arkansas (NNP)] marriage had been rocky , but [he (PRP)| GOVERNOR Bill Clinton of Arkansas (NNP)] denied allegations of a 12-year-long affair with a former Arkansas state employee and part-time cabaret singer 
Ms Gennifer Flowers , the employee , last night held a news conference in New York in which [she (PRP)| Gennifer Flowers (NNP)] accused Mr Clinton of lying when [he (PRP)| GOVERNOR Bill Clinton of Arkansas (NNP)] claimed [they (PRP)| friends (NNS)] were just friends 
[She (PRP)| Gennifer Flowers (NNP)] said : [I (PRP)| US (NNP)] was Bill Clinton's lover for 12 years ... [he (PRP)| GOVERNOR Bill Clinton of Arkansas (NNP)] is absolutely lying 
[I (PRP)| US (NNP)] am disappointed , but realistically [I (PRP)| US (NNP)] never thought [he (PRP)| GOVERNOR Bill Clinton of Arkansas (NNP)] would come out and admit [it (PRP)| 12 years (NNS)] 
In response to one question , [she (PRP)| Gennifer Flowers (NNP)] said the local Republican party in Arkansas had offered [her (PRP$)| Gennifer Flowers (NNP)] money six months ago to reveal [her (PRP$)| Gennifer Flowers (NNP)] affair with Mr Clinton , but [she (PRP)| Gennifer Flowers (NNP)] had refused 
[She (PRP)| Gennifer Flowers (NNP)] said [she (PRP)| Gennifer Flowers (NNP)] had lied to the press to protect [him (PRP)| Republican (NNP)] and that later [she (PRP)| Gennifer Flowers (NNP)] sold [her (PRP$)| Gennifer Flowers (NNP)] story to a supermarket tabloid because [he (PRP)| Republican (NNP)] had angered [her (PRP)| Gennifer Flowers (NNP)] 
At the press conference Ms Flowers played 10 minutes of tape-recorded telephone conversation she said was between [her (PRP)| Ms Gennifer Flowers (NNP)] and Mr Clinton 
Published excerpts of these tapes have so far proved inconclusive and questions have surfaced about [her (PRP$)| Ms Gennifer Flowers (NNP)] credibility 
Ms Flowers maintains [she (PRP)| Ms Gennifer Flowers (NNP)] met Mr Clinton in 1979 and 1980 at the Excelsior Hotel in Little Rock 
But the hotel did not open until 1982 
[She (PRP)| Ms Gennifer Flowers (NNP)] also claims to have reported on Mr Clinton while working with a local TV station , but Little Rock's KARK-TV said [it (PRP)| Little Rock's KARK-TV (NNP)] could find no tapes to support this 
Mr Clinton , the early front-runner for the Democratic nomination , was judged yesterday to have taken a huge gamble by appearing on CBS's programme Sixty Minutes, which generally attracts more than 30m viewers 
Although [his (PRP$)| GOVERNOR Bill Clinton of Arkansas (NNP)] campaign advisers said the sex scandal rumours were drowning out the Arkansas governor's message to voters , the risk was [his (PRP$)| GOVERNOR Bill Clinton of Arkansas (NNP)] confessions could draw further media scrutiny just three weeks before the critical New Hampshire primary election 
Mr Clinton , 46 , appeared calm and good-humoured throughout the interview 
[I (PRP)| US (NNP)] have acknowledged causing pain in [my (PRP$)| US (NNP)] marriage , [he (PRP)| GOVERNOR Bill Clinton of Arkansas (NNP)] said 
[I (PRP)| US (NNP)] have said things to [you tonight (PRP)| US (NNP)] and to the American people from the beginning that no American politician ever has 
But in response to a question on whether [he (PRP)| no American politician (NN)] had ever committed adultery , Mr Clinton avoided a clear-cut response 
[I (PRP)| US (NNP)] am not prepared to say tonight that any married couple should ever discuss that with anyone but themselves 
[He (PRP)| anyone but themselves (NN)] appealed to the US public for fairness and urged the media to respect [his (PRP$)| anyone but themselves (NN)] privacy , instead of turning the 1992 campaign into a game of gotcha 
Mr Clinton saw [his (PRP$)| GOVERNOR Bill Clinton of Arkansas (NNP)] popularity fall sharply last week among likely Democratic voters in New Hampshire , Reuter reports from Boston 
In a poll by the American Research Group , which has conducted daily surveys in advance of the February 18 primary , support for Mr Clinton fell 14 percentage points in five days last week 
The latest polling data put Mr Clinton in second place , with 25 per cent , to Mr Paul Tsongas , a former Massachusetts senator , who has 27 per cent of voterssupport
