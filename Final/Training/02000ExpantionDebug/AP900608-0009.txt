Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton secured a solid majority to win [his (PRP$)| Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton (NNP)] sixth straight Democratic nomination 
But , like a boxing champion who slipped by on points , [he (PRP)| a boxing champion who slipped by on points (NN)] is being asked to explain the lack of a knockout punch 
Clinton , 43 , was the nation's youngest governor when first elected in 1978 and [he (PRP)| Bill Clinton (NNP)] has had a stranglehold on the state's Democratic Party ever since 
But in last week's primary , [he (PRP)| Bill Clinton (NNP)] garnered just 55 percent of the vote while Tom McRae , an unpolished campaigner who heads a public policy think tank , earned 39 percent 
Four also-rans divided the rest 
Clinton , who toyed with the idea of running for the presidency in 1988 and already is talking about 1996 , said [he (PRP)| Bill Clinton (NNP)] saw no cause for concern in the margin of [his (PRP$)| Bill Clinton (NNP)] primary victory 
[I (PRP)| Bill Clinton (NNP)] did not see how [I (PRP)| Bill Clinton (NNP)] could get 60 percent , knowing the number of people who were saying in the surveys that they thought [I (PRP)| Bill Clinton (NNP)] was a good governor but were concerned about the tenure issue , Clinton said recently 
Tenure was summed up repeatedly by McRae as 10 years is long enough 
Arkansans grow bored with their politicians sooner than voters elsewhere , Clinton said , in part because politics in the state is so personal 
Pumping hands at shopping malls and crawfish festivals is considered as important as running the right television ad 
[I (PRP)| Bill Clinton (NNP)] am just trying to tell people that in business they would not fire a 43-year-old with 10 years of experience who is doing a good job , Clinton said days before the primary 
Sheffield Nelson , who upset Rep. Tommy Robinson for the Republican gubernatorial nomination , already is jumping on the theme , saying Arkansas is ready for a change 
Clinton , who has focused on improving the state's education system , counters by calling [himself (PRP)| Sheffield Nelson , who upset Rep. Tommy Robinson for the Republican gubernatorial nomination (NNP)] the candidate of change 
Frankly , if you look at what [I (PRP)| Bill Clinton (NNP)] proposed , compared with the others , [it (PRP)| the state's education system (NN)] represents more change , [he (PRP)| Bill Clinton (NNP)] said 
Ten years is an asset , not a liability 
Clinton lost [his (PRP$)| Bill Clinton (NNP)] first re-election bid in 1980 to Republican Frank White , but won again in 1982 , 1984 and 1986 , when the gubernatorial term was changed to four years 
[He (PRP)| Bill Clinton (NNP)] has all but promised not to run for the White House in 1992 if re-elected this year 
[His (PRP$)| Bill Clinton (NNP)] showing in this year's primary , largely in line with pre-election polls , was the first time since his political comeback in 1982 that Clinton got less than 60 percent of the primary vote 
[I (PRP)| Bill Paschall , a Little Rock political consultant (NNP)] am sure the governor would like to have made a better showing , but when you are in office 10 years you have a lot of friends and a lot of enemies , said Bill Paschall , a Little Rock political consultant 
[I (PRP)| Bill Paschall , a Little Rock political consultant (NNP)] do not think [it (PRP)| a better showing (NN)] is a death blow that [he (PRP)| Bill Clinton (NNP)] made 55 (percent ), but [it (PRP)| a better showing (NN)] shows [him (PRP)| Bill Clinton (NNP)] [he (PRP)| Bill Clinton (NNP)] has to work harder 
While the biggest complaint against Clinton appears to be that [he (PRP)| Bill Clinton (NNP)] has been in office too long , the governor also has been accused of being more interested in [his (PRP$)| Bill Clinton (NNP)] national ambitions than state concerns 
Clinton's recent troubles with the legislature also have been a sticking point 
Twice in 1989 [he (PRP)| Bill Clinton (NNP)] failed to win legislative approval for proposals to increase taxes 
Nelson , who hopes to paint Clinton as a tax-and-spend Democrat , said the primary election results show the governor is on the ropes 
[I (PRP)| Sheffield Nelson , who upset Rep. Tommy Robinson for the Republican gubernatorial nomination (NNP)] would say against an unknown who never held an office , [I (PRP)| Sheffield Nelson , who upset Rep. Tommy Robinson for the Republican gubernatorial nomination (NNP)] think that was low 
[It (PRP)| an office (NN)] probably did make some bells go off in [his (PRP$)| Bill Clinton (NNP)] head , Nelson said 
Clinton said [he (PRP)| Bill Clinton (NNP)] would have done better if a large number of traditional Democrats had not crossed over to the GOP primary to vote against Robinson 
We did poorly in areas where [I (PRP)| Bill Clinton (NNP)] did not campaign ; where my supporters , in spite of my best interest , believed the polls and did not work ; and where we did a poor job of telling the people what [I (PRP)| Bill Clinton (NNP)] had done that affected [their (PRP$)| my supporters (NNS)] lives ; and where people knew there was an alternative but did not know much about what the alternative was , Clinton said 
Betsey Wright , Clinton's former chief of staff , said the governor's supporters were complacent 
Bill Clinton is always perceived as being so strong that people find [it (PRP)| spite of my best interest (NN)] difficult to believe in calls for such cohesion and tight energies , [she (PRP)| Betsey Wright (NNP)] said of the primary
