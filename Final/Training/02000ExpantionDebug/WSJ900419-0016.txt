A new cancer drug proved strikingly successful with very few side effects in treating a relatively rare form of leukemia , researchers said 
The drug , called 2-CdA , was nearly 100 % effective treating 12 patients with hairy-cell leukemia 
The patients underwent just one seven-day treatment and experienced almost none of the debilitating side effects such as vomiting , hair-loss and kidney and liver problems associated with other chemotherapy 
The results need to be replicated by other researchers before definitive conclusions can be made , and the long-term effect of the treatment remains unknown 
But the initial experience with the compound is especially promising , and an apparent improvement over other therapy for the disease , scientists said 
There are not many -LCB- drugs -RCB- where you can administer one course of treatment and have the disease go away and stay away for as long as four years , says Lawrence Piro , chief of cancer research at Scripps Clinic & Research Foundation , La Jolla , Calif. , where the drug was developed 
The leukemia has not come back in any of the patients we treated 
The study is published in today's New England Journal of Medicine 
[It (PRP)| the most effective treatment for hairy-cell leukemia , in terms of rapidity of response (NN)] is without doubt the most effective treatment for hairy-cell leukemia , in terms of rapidity of response , adds Elihu H. Estey , a cancer researcher at the University of Texas-M.D. Anderson Cancer Center , Houston 
Dr. Estey recently began treating patients with 2-CdA and has had similar results with five patients 
It is a striking finding , [he (PRP)| Elihu H. Estey (NNP)] says 
It is very unlikely to be a fluke 
Hairy-cell leukemia , so-called because of the appearance of the cancerous cells under the microscope , affects about 6,000 people in the U.S. , with 600 new cases a year 
As the disease progresses , patients become anemic , are vulnerable to infection and often need blood transfusions 
Until the mid-1980s , treatments were ineffective , and patients often died of blood problems and infections 
Since then , alpha interferon , a drug sold by Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. and Schering-Plough Corp. and an experimental drug called deoxycoformycin have significantly reduced death rates from hairy-cell leukemia 
Hoffmann-La Roche is the U.S. subsidiary of F. Hoffmann-La Roche & Co. of Switzerland 
But neither drug is as effective as 2-CdA appears to be in low doses and both can cause such side effects as nausea , vomiting , skin rashes and nervous-system disorders , researchers say 
With the lack of toxicity and the ease with which people go into remission -LCB- with 2-CdA -RCB- , [I (PRP)| Ellin Berman , a staff leukemia doctor at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center , New York (NNP)] think there is something really going on here , says Ellin Berman , a staff leukemia doctor at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center , New York 
Scripps said [it (PRP)| Scripps Clinic & Research Foundation (NNP)] negotiated an agreement with a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson , New Brunswick , N.J. , to produce and distribute 2-CdA to other centers for broader clinical trials 
The researchers said the drug is easy to produce and thus is likely to be less expensive than other cancer treatments 
In the 12-patient study , 2-CdA , short for 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine , was administered continuously for seven days to patients aged 36 to 61 
Within eight to 10 weeks , 11 of the patients had no trace of cancer in [their (PRP$)| 12 patients (NNS)] blood or bone marrow ; the 12th had a small amount remaining in the marrow , but he declined further bone marrow monitoring , Dr. Piro said 
[His (PRP$)| no trace of cancer (NN)] blood tests are normal , Dr. Piro added 
None of the patients have had a relapse ; complete remission has lasted from seven to 46 months after treatment , according to the study 
When [you (PRP)| Ellin Berman , a staff leukemia doctor at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center , New York (NNP)] can make all the disease go away with a single infusion of therapy , [you (PRP)| Ellin Berman , a staff leukemia doctor at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center , New York (NNP)] have a disease which may be able to be cured , Dr. Piro said 
But because hairy-cell leukemia proliferates slowly , a relapse could occur long after treatment 
Longer follow-up is necessary to determine whether 2-CdA actually cures the disease 
The drug was first made about 10 years ago at Scripps by Dennis A. Carson , who studied severe combined immunodeficiency disease , made famous a few years ago by the Texas boy that lived in a bubble 
People with that disease lack an enzyme that processes deoxyadenosine , a chemical that , without the enzyme , builds up in infection-fighting white blood cells and kills [them (PRP)| People with that disease (NNS)] 
Since cancer patients have the enzyme , Scripps scientists developed a compound that mimics deoxyadenosine , but tricks the enzyme so [it (PRP)| the enzyme (NN)] ca not be processed 
The compound then kills the white blood cells , including those that are cancerous 
New , normal white cells are then generated in the bone marrow 
Because hairy-cell leukemia is rare , a 12-patient study is considered a pretty good series , says Sloan-Kettering's Dr. Berman 
[It (PRP)| a 12-patient study (NN)] is ironic that we have three active drugs for a disease that is fairly rare , but for some of the more common forms of leukemia , we do not yet have good treatments 
Dr. Piro said 2-CdA has also been used effectively in initial trials to treat more common cancers , including chronic lymphocytic leukemia , non-Hodgkins lymphoma and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma 
About 50 % to 60 % of patients most of whom had failed other treatments responded to the drug , some with complete remission , he said 
Now , [we (PRP)| patients most of whom had failed other treatments (NNS)] will use -LCB- 2-CdA -RCB- as a first treatment to see if response and remission are higher , he said 
Meanwhile , researchers at University of California at San Francisco are testing 2-CdA on AIDS-related lymphoma
