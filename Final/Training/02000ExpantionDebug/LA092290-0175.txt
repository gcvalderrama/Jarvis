A Los Angeles judge Friday refused to reduce the $ 5-million bail for Charles H. Keating Jr. , saying the Phoenix businessman is a flight risk after being indicted on 42 counts of state securities fraud and other violations 
Superior Court Judge Gary Klausner said Keating pursued by creditors , regulators and prosecutors for [his (PRP$)| Superior Court Judge Gary Klausner (NNP)] role in the failure of Irvine-based Lincoln Savings & Loan has significant reasons not to stay around 
The ruling means that the 66-year-old Keating a once-wealthy real estate developer , lawyer and influential political campaign contributor used to pin-striped suits will spend more time in blue prison fatigues inside Los Angeles County Jail 
At the same time , Klausner reduced bail for three Keating co-defendants from the $ 1 million [he (PRP)| Superior Court Judge Gary Klausner (NNP)] imposed Tuesday when the indictment was unsealed against the former operators of American Continental Corp. and [its (PRP$)| the indictment (NN)] former main subsidiary , Lincoln 
Bail for Judy J. Wischer , 42 , former American Continental president , was lowered to $ 200,000 
Bail for Robin S. Symes , 37 , and Ray C. Fidel , 32 , both former Lincoln presidents , was cut to $ 100,000 
All three posted bail late Friday and were expected to be released during the night 
The four are charged with wrongdoing in the sale of more than $ 200 million in American Continental bonds to thousands of mostly elderly Southern California investors 
The bonds were sold through Lincoln branches , allegedly as safe and insured investments 
The bonds became worthless when American Continental filed for bankruptcy in April , 1989 
The next day Lincoln was declared insolvent and seized by federal regulators 
The failure is expected to cost taxpayers $ 2 billion 
Stephen C. Neal , Keating's attorney , indicated [he (PRP)| Stephen C. Neal (NNP)] would appeal Klausner's ruling 
Keating will not flee and intends to fight to clear [his (PRP$)| Mr. Keating (NNP)] name , Neal said 
But the decision denies Keating access to his attorneys and to records so [he (PRP)| Mr. Keating (NNP)] can mount a defense effectively , the lawyer said 
[We (PRP)| his attorneys (NNS)] think (the decision )is unsupportable on the evidence that was introduced this week , Neal said 
Keating had sought to have bail reduced to $ 500,000 , an amount that could be paid by [his (PRP$)| Mr. Keating (NNP)] family , Neal said 
Neal argued that Keating , who three years ago had a net worth of nearly $ 40 million , is broke 
Keating's former accountant testified that [his (PRP$)| Keating's former accountant (NN)] debts exceed [his (PRP$)| Keating's former accountant (NN)] assets by $ 5.2 million 
Los Angeles County Dist 
Atty. Ira Reiner , whose office has flip-flopped twice in [its (PRP$)| Los Angeles County Dist (NNP)] bail recommendations in the case , praised the decision not to reduce Keating's bail 
Mr. Keating is accused of cheating people out of their savings , Reiner said in a press conference after the hearing 
For many of them , it was their life savings 
And whether somebody wears an expensive suit or a cheap mask , stealing is stealing and both of them ought to be treated the same 
The judge's decision came after 1Â 1/2 days of testimony and arguments in the first criminal case to be filed in connection with the collapses of Lincoln and Phoenix-based American Continental 
Keating , unshaven and looking tired , sat impassively in the prisonersblock as the judge announced [his (PRP$)| A Los Angeles judge (NN)] decision 
Afterwards , Donald Smaltz , attorney for Symes , criticized Reiner and Klausner for [their (PRP$)| Reiner and Klausner (NNP)] handling of the bail hearing 
The most talked about event in the last several weeks has been the Iraqi invasion , Smaltz said 
The sole thing that replaced Saddam Hussein on the front page was Charles Keating , and Reiner's milking that for all [it (PRP)| The sole thing that replaced Saddam Hussein on the front page (NN)] is worth 
[He (PRP)| Saddam Hussein on the front page (NNP)] also struck out at the judge , saying , [He (PRP)| Saddam Hussein on the front page (NNP)] is never going to get arrested for flashing [his (PRP$)| Saddam Hussein on the front page (NNP)] Phi Beta Kappa key 
Bail is supposed to assure a defendant's appearance in court and must be within the means [he (PRP)| a defendant's (NN)] could reasonably afford 
Klausner also said [he (PRP)| Superior Court Judge Gary Klausner (NNP)] was troubled by the way the district attorney has equivocated on the bail issue 
On Tuesday , when the indictments were unsealed , prosecutors did not object to releasing all the defendants on [their (PRP$)| prosecutors (NNS)] own recognizance 
On Wednesday , prosecutors said [they (PRP)| prosecutors (NNS)] were willing to recommend a reduction in bail to $ 1 million for Keating and $ 50,000 for the others 
Friday , Deputy Dist 
Atty. Paul W. Turley argued against reducing the bail 
Reiner , who was appointed a special state prosecutor by Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp to investigate Lincoln , said [he (PRP)| Ira Reiner (NNP)] was willing to let the defendants go without bail on Tuesday because [he (PRP)| Ira Reiner (NNP)] did not want to face a difficult battle extraditing Keating from Arizona 
After Klausner first ruled , Reiner said [he (PRP)| Superior Court Judge Gary Klausner (NNP)] then supported the bail set 
But asked why his office changed [his (PRP$)| Superior Court Judge Gary Klausner (NNP)] mind later , [he (PRP)| Superior Court Judge Gary Klausner (NNP)] said , [I (PRP)| Superior Court Judge Gary Klausner (NNP)] am not sure that [I (PRP)| Superior Court Judge Gary Klausner (NNP)] understand the semantic difference 
While defense attorneys would not say what [they (PRP)| defense attorneys (NNS)] thought of the prosecutor's actions , other lawyers connected indirectly to the case scored Reiner for allegedly using the case and [his (PRP$)| a special state prosecutor (NN)] changing views on Keating's bail to bolster [his (PRP$)| a special state prosecutor (NN)] public image 
Klausner said that of all the factors to be weighed in determining a proper bail , the seriousness of the alleged crimes and the risk of a defendant fleeing were the most important in this case 
Throughout the hearing , defense attorneys brought witnesses and other evidence to court to show that [their (PRP$)| defense attorneys (NNS)] clients were destitute or nearly so 
[They (PRP)| defense attorneys (NNS)] argued that the defendants would return to court for trial to fight for [their (PRP$)| the defendants (NNS)] vindication , as [they (PRP)| the defendants (NNS)] had stayed to fight the massive civil litigation filed against [them (PRP)| the defendants (NNS)] 
Keating and the others also have known [they (PRP)| Keating and $ 50,000 for the others (NNP)] were targets of state and federal criminal investigations for a long time and would have fled the country by now if [they (PRP)| Keating and $ 50,000 for the others (NNP)] had wanted to avoid prosecution , [their (PRP$)| Keating and $ 50,000 for the others (NNP)] attorneys said 
[They (PRP)| Keating and $ 50,000 for the others (NNP)] also argued that the indictment contains no information about specific wrongdoing , alleging only violations of certain laws regarding the sale of American Continental debt securities at Lincoln offices to 20 people 
The alleged crimes caused the victims to lose nearly $ 1.2 million , hardly serious enough to warrant such high bails , [they (PRP)| the victims (NNS)] contended 
But Turley contended that the 20 people represented a much bigger group of investors who lost much more money , throwing in a new figure in the often-changing number of total victims 
[He (PRP)| Atty. Paul W. Turley (NNP)] said 17,458 small investors had bought $ 250 million in American Continental bonds at Lincoln 
[He (PRP)| Atty. Paul W. Turley (NNP)] reminded the court of one major distinction between this case and other thrift fraud cases 
The victims are individuals deprived of [their (PRP$)| the victims (NNS)] own particular finances , [he (PRP)| Atty. Paul W. Turley (NNP)] said , not taxpayers asked to foot the bill for the entire thrift debacle , now estimated at $ 500 billion over the next 30 years 
Reiner said that , though [his (PRP$)| Ira Reiner (NNP)] office had no evidence that Keating would flee , [you (PRP)| Atty. Paul W. Turley (NNP)] ca not escape the thought of Mr. Robert Vesco in a case like this 
Vesco , a New Jersey financier indicted in 1972 for allegedly defrauding four firms out of $ 224 million , fled the country and remains at large
