So , you say , what will happen when they lock four men and four women inside this fancy fish bowl for two years and watch 'em grow alfalfa sprouts and rice ? 
How , indeed , are eight biospherians going to fare testing the completely sealed compound with five adjacent but contrasting environments , called biomes , as well as an intensive agricultural complex , to duplicate the Earth's ecology ? 
How are [they (PRP)| biospherians going to fare testing the completely sealed compound with five adjacent but contrasting environments (NNS)] going to react in shepherding 3,800 species of plants and animals that will provide food and air while all wastes are recycled within Biosphere II ? 
And in getting along with each other ? 
Exceedingly well , according to predictions 
It is unlikely , all agree , that any of the eight crew members to be selected later this year from among 14 candidates in this $ 30 million private experiment , will go bonkers 
Withdrawal or confrontation under stress are unlikely , all say 
[They (PRP)| the eight crew members (NNS)] are so highly motivated in the first place , [I (PRP)| Robert B. Bechtel , an environmental psychologist at the University of Arizona (NNP)] would not be surprised to see the whole thing go through without a hitch , personnel-wise , said Robert B. Bechtel , an environmental psychologist at the University of Arizona 
My guess would be that [they (PRP)| the eight crew members (NNS)] would probably have somewhat fewer problems than you would normally encounter in the classical isolation experience , said Mary Connors , a psychologist and division staff member at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Ames Research Center near Sunnyvale , Calif. , who until recently was acting chief of [its (PRP$)| My guess (NN)] Crew Research and Space Human Factors Branch 
[They (PRP)| the eight crew members (NNS)] just have more options 
The biospherians will be physically separated from the outside world , or Biosphere I , but [they (PRP)| biospherians going to fare testing the completely sealed compound with five adjacent but contrasting environments (NNS)] will not be isolated , said John Rummel , a life sciences physician at NASA 
Nor are [they (PRP)| biospherians going to fare testing the completely sealed compound with five adjacent but contrasting environments (NNS)] likely to suffer sensory deprivation or claustrophobia in the main compound , which measures 2 \ acres 
[They (PRP)| biospherians going to fare testing the completely sealed compound with five adjacent but contrasting environments (NNS)] will have the latest gadgets , from video teleconferencing and worldwide phone contact to television , VCRs and computers in their plush apartment complex and office-laboratory area 
And [they (PRP)| biospherians going to fare testing the completely sealed compound with five adjacent but contrasting environments (NNS)] will have unusual options if [they (PRP)| biospherians going to fare testing the completely sealed compound with five adjacent but contrasting environments (NNS)] want to get away from each other 
The biospherians will be able to stargaze from [their (PRP$)| biospherians going to fare testing the completely sealed compound with five adjacent but contrasting environments (NNS)] own rain forest or ocean beach 
Experiments in long-term situations where small groups of people live in harsh climatic or environmental extremes , such as the in Antarctica or underwater , usually are viewed in terms of isolation , confinement , deprivation and risk , Connors said 
But crew members will be allowed to leave through air locks if health or extreme family emergencies necessitate , eliminating the sense of risk , [she (PRP)| Mary Connors (NNP)] said 
Roy Walford , a pathologist , nutrition specialist and the only physician seeking one of the eight slots , says [he (PRP)| Roy Walford (NNP)] thinks the biggest problem may be overwork 
A community and rural health family practitioner associated with the University of Arizona who has developed a close relationship with the candidates will be among those watching from the outside 
Walford and Biosphere spokeswoman Kathleen Dyhr , also hoping to make the crew , said each candidate has worked on the project for at least three years 
Ms. Dyhr said the selection process uses no psychological testing 
Rather , such factors as ability to work together , problem-solving skills , willingness to accept other views and professionalism are keys , and by selecting for some of those factors [you (PRP)| Mary Connors (NNP)] can relieve a lot of interpersonal tensions 
Connors and Bechtel said the strong job focus , cross-work training and the fact that the potential crew members have worked and spent significant time together all are highly advantageous 
Creativity , spontaneity , withdrawal , unexpected irritability , eating patterns and general health will be watched , but the best sensors likely will be the crew members [themselves (PRP)| Connors and Bechtel (NNP)] 
Most say the crew will develop [its (PRP$)| Creativity , spontaneity , withdrawal , unexpected irritability , eating patterns and general health (NN)] own equilibrium once closed life gets under way 
But will that lead to romantic relationships , to interludes under the waterfall or in the huge basements beneath the complex ? 
Will the crew be celibate ? 
Views range from who cares to unlikely to probable 
Mine has always been that it is unlikely , because [I (PRP)| Mary Connors (NNP)] think people tend to act as crews when [they (PRP)| people (NNS)] get in an experience that is prolonged , Connors said 
[I (PRP)| Mary Connors (NNP)] would suspect that [they (PRP)| people (NNS)] would get into a familial relationship rather than a couples relationship ... more like siblings act , [she (PRP)| Mary Connors (NNP)] said 
Bechtel said : How could [you (PRP)| Mary Connors (NNP)] avoid [it (PRP)| a familial relationship rather than a couples relationship (NN)] ? 
But on the other hand , [they (PRP)| people (NNS)] are in a fish bowl 
Let's just put it this way , Ms. Dyhr said , there is nothing really that a corporation can do about what [their (PRP$)| people (NNS)] employees do after 5 o'clock 
We live in a free country and for the most part people do whatever [they (PRP)| people (NNS)] want to do 
But what if two people fall in love ? 
Is marriage by teleconferencing possible ? 
Given the fact that various members of the clergy have shown themselves to be innovative and agreeable to doing marriages under very unusual circumstances , [I (PRP)| Kathleen Dyhr (NNP)] am sure that [they (PRP)| various members of the clergy (NNS)] could find a way to do [it (PRP)| the fact that various members of the clergy have shown themselves to be innovative and agreeable to doing marriages under very unusual circumstances (NN)] , Ms. Dyhr said 
On the other extreme , the psychologists say literature on confinement and isolation studies shows few examples of violence 
The Biosphere's purpose is not to test interpersonal relations , but to test whether [they (PRP)| the psychologists (NNS)] can reproduce the Earth's atmosphere by a mixture of plants , animals and bacteria , Bechtel said 
Bechtel thinks the biggest problem will be whether seals around the glass panels covering the gigantic geodesic dome stay under wide ranges of heat and cold 
[He (PRP)| Robert B. Bechtel , an environmental psychologist at the University of Arizona (NNP)] and Connors also said most studies of crews , including mixed-sex groups in environments far harsher and smaller than the biospherians are likely to encounter , have shown [them (PRP)| crews (NNS)] to be highly motivated , energetic and willing to put up with almost anything for the sake of the project and the team's success 
Bechtel said the public has a misconception that putting eight people together will mean all kinds of interesting things can happen 
Rather , [he (PRP)| Robert B. Bechtel , an environmental psychologist at the University of Arizona (NNP)] said , [They (PRP)| eight people (NNS)] are really caretakers 
[They (PRP)| eight people (NNS)] are really out there to tend the plants and animals 
[It (PRP)| a misconception that putting eight people together will mean all kinds of interesting things can happen (NN)] is a kind of farming adventure
