WASHINGTON Iraq's Saddam Hussein , [his (PRP$)| Saddam Hussein (NNP)] options for ending the Persian Gulf crisis growing increasingly unpleasant , assumed the role of embattled Arab hero in offering his first rough proposal for a negotiated end to the confrontation 
The Iraqi leader , in an initiative designed as much to rally Arab public opinion as to launch meaningful negotiations , announced yesterday that [he (PRP)| The Iraqi leader (NN)] will withdraw [his (PRP$)| The Iraqi leader (NN)] troops from Kuwait only if Israel withdraws from the West Bank and Syria from Lebanon 
[He (PRP)| The Iraqi leader (NN)] apparently hopes to lure support from Arabs who have spurned him so far by suggesting that Iraq will use its occupation of Kuwait as a lever to solve the Arab world's most frustrating problem , the 23-year Israeli occupation of land claimed by Palestinians 
Even as Saddam Hussein was searching for a ploy to ease [his (PRP$)| Saddam Hussein (NNP)] isolation , though , the international pressure against [him (PRP)| Saddam Hussein (NNP)] clicked up another notch 
The White House yesterday disclosed that Kuwait's ousted government has formally asked the U.S. to enforce the total trade embargo the United Nations has imposed on Iraq , allowing the U.S. and other nations to immediately begin stopping ships carrying Iraqi goods 
Secretary of State James Baker , speaking on ABC NewsThis Week , said the Kuwaiti request gives the U.S. and other countries a legal basis for stopping the export of oil and that sort of thing 
The U.S. maintains that under the U.N. charter , the Kuwaiti request triggers steps for the collective enforcement of international sanctions 
Mr. Baker declined to use the word blockade , but said that interdiction of Iraqi shipments would begin almost instantly 
In a statement , the White House said [it (PRP)| a statement (NN)] would do whatever is necessary to ensure compliance with the sanctions 
Other Bush administration officials said that the international naval force in the area consisting of American , British , French , Canadian , Soviet , German and Australian ships may be used both to stop oil exports from leaving Iraq and Kuwait and to stop shipments of food and other goods from going in 
President Bush implied as much yesterday when reporters asked whether the interdiction would apply to food 
The president responded , Everything , everything 
While shying away from actually using the word blockade , Mr. Bush acknowledged that the U.S. and others were trying to block shipping to Iraq 
No point getting into all these semantics , [he (PRP)| President Bush (NNP)] said 
The main thing is to stop the oil from coming out of there 
The naval interdiction force is part of an overall American strategy that officials say is designed to leave the Iraqi leader with only the stark choice of backing out of Kuwait or launching new attacks to change [his (PRP$)| The Iraqi leader (NN)] situation 
Though [they (PRP)| Other Bush administration officials (NNS)] insist [they (PRP)| Other Bush administration officials (NNS)] are not trying to lure Saddam Hussein into an attack , officials hope that if [he (PRP)| Saddam Hussein (NNP)] strikes again , the U.S. and its allies will have such an impressive force in place in Saudi Arabia that [they (PRP)| its allies (NNS)] will be able to crush [him (PRP)| Saddam Hussein (NNP)] in retaliation 
Iraq's first option , of course , may be simply to sit tight and hope [it (PRP)| Iraq's first option (NN)] can endure a trade embargo longer than the West can live without Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil 
Speaking on the ABC program , Abdul Amir al-Anbari , Iraq's ambassador to the U.N. , asserted that an embargo on Iraq could plunge the U.S. into a depression and the rest of the world into an economic crisis 
Iraq clearly is trying to woo back more Arab support in case the conflict drags on , hoping that [its (PRP$)| the conflict (NN)] neighbors eventually will help [it (PRP)| the conflict (NN)] survive a prolonged war of economic attrition with the West 
So Saddam Hussein on Friday tried to scare other Arab leaders into supporting [him (PRP)| Arab (NNP)] by calling on Arabs to rise up in a holy war against leaders who invited American and other Western soldiers into Saudi Arabia to protect the oil-rich kingdom 
Then yesterday , [he (PRP)| Saddam Hussein on Friday (NNP)] tried to entice Arab leaders with [his (PRP$)| Arab (NNP)] proposal for a diplomatic solution linking [his (PRP$)| Arab (NNP)] occupation of Kuwait with Israel's occupation of the West Bank 
The proposal also called for replacing American and other Western troops in Saudi Arabia with Arab forces 
The Bush administration immediately said [it (PRP)| The Bush administration (NN)] categorically rejects the proposals 
And President Bush yesterday , asked whether [he (PRP)| President Bush yesterday (NNP)] was at least glad Iraq is discussing negotiations , replied : [I (PRP)| Iraq's (NNP)] do not see anything to be pleasing in there at all 
American strategists are calculating , though , that the trade sanctions enforced by an effective though perhaps undeclared naval blockade will hold tightly enough to convince Iraq that [it (PRP)| Iraq's (NNP)] will lose in the long run by simply standing pat 
At that point , rather than go through the humiliation of backing out of Kuwait , the Iraqis might well conclude that [they (PRP)| American strategists (NNS)] need to lash out in some way to shake things up 
In that event , Saddam Hussein appears to have three choices 
The first would be to launch the much-feared direct invasion of Saudi Arabia , hoping to seize some Saudi oil fields and improve [his (PRP$)| Saddam Hussein (NNP)] bargaining position 
But that option is growing less and less likely as thousands of American , British , Egyptian , Syrian and Moroccan forces assemble in and around Saudi Arabia to protect the kingdom 
The Saudis even have in [their (PRP$)| thousands of American , British , Egyptian (NNS)] possession 48 Kuwaiti jet fighters , virtually the entire Kuwaiti air force , which managed to escape the Iraqi invasion , Saudi officials said 
The Saudi window of vulnerability ... is closing very fast , Prince Bandar bin Sultan , the Saudi ambassador to Washington , said over the weekend 
The second possibility would be to start a fight with Israel , in hopes that all Arabs would have to move behind Iraq in a fight against [their (PRP$)| thousands of American , British , Egyptian (NNS)] common Israeli enemy 
In such an event , Saddam Hussein also might calculate , the Saudis would be under pressure to kick out U.S. troops because of America's close ties with Israel 
Iraq could start hostilities with Israel either through a direct attack or by attacking Jordan 
Israel has publicly declared that [it (PRP)| Israel (NNP)] will respond to an Iraqi attack on Jordan because [it (PRP)| Israel (NNP)] wo not allow Iraq's dangerous army to take control of Jordan's long border with Israel 
Iraq's third attack option would be to start an undeclared war on the U.S. and other Western nations through terrorism 
Two Middle East terrorists with records of successful attacks against Western targets , Abu Nidal and Abu Abbas , have ties to Baghdad 
And even terrorist groups that opposed Iraq in its war with Iran show signs of swinging behind Saddam Hussein now that [he (PRP)| Saddam Hussein (NNP)] is in a confrontation with the U.S. And Iraq still has thousands of Americans and other Westerners under [its (PRP$)| Iraq's (NNP)] control in Iraq and Kuwait 
[They (PRP)| even terrorist groups that opposed Iraq in its war with Iran (NNS)] are not being allowed to leave and could become hostages 
If Iraq chooses a simple war of nerves and economic attrition , the Bush administration knows a long stalemate could try the patience of the American public and the West in general , and could open the possibility that moderate Arabs even including Saudi Arabia might drop out of the effort against Iraq and accept some deal from Saddam Hussein 
But U.S. officials have sized up Saddam Hussein as a man who , despite some recklessness , will back down if [he (PRP)| President Bush (NNP)] must 
This is a guy who is impulsive , and therefore capable of big miscalculations , says one senior administration official involved in managing the crisis 
The official adds , though , that at the same time , [we (PRP)| U.S. officials (NNS)] think [he (PRP)| a guy who is impulsive , and therefore capable of big miscalculations (NN)] is someone who is capable of rational judgments when [it (PRP)| the same time (NN)] comes to power 
And when [he (PRP)| a guy who is impulsive , and therefore capable of big miscalculations (NN)] finds something is unprofitable , then one can see certain accommodations 
Thus , administration aides will be trying to calculate whether Saddam Hussein's proposed diplomatic formula for getting out of Kuwait represents the first sign [he (PRP)| Saddam Hussein (NNP)] is searching for a way out or simply is a public relations stunt 
There are disagreements among experts about how much pressure will be needed to make Saddam Hussein decide [he (PRP)| Saddam Hussein (NNP)] is up against the wall and whether simple economic pressure will ever be enough 
The biggest worry is that if [he (PRP)| Saddam Hussein (NNP)] decides [he (PRP)| Saddam Hussein (NNP)] needs a way out of [his (PRP$)| Saddam Hussein (NNP)] predicament but does not see a face-saving method , [he (PRP)| Saddam Hussein (NNP)] could lash out in dangerous and unpredictable ways 
U.S. officials claim [they (PRP)| U.S. officials (NNS)] already see signs Saddam Hussein is getting nervous 
In the first days after President Bush announced the dispatching of U.S. troops , they note , the Iraqi leader made several nationwide addresses indirectly having them read by a television announcer 
That shows [he (PRP)| President Bush (NNP)] is nervous about pinpointing [his (PRP$)| President Bush (NNP)] location , either because [he (PRP)| President Bush (NNP)] is afraid we will find [him (PRP)| President Bush (NNP)] , or that internal enemies will , says one U.S. official 
The unpredictability of Iraq's leader is a principal reason the U.S. is going to such great lengths to build a mammoth force in and around Saudi Arabia 
Pentagon officials say the goal is to put 40,000 troops in the region by the end of the month 
But the administration is not putting any upper limit on how high the force could go after that , calculating that it would be a mistake to underestimate and an advantage to keep Saddam Hussein guessing 
U.S. commanders in charge of planning for Middle East crises have indicated in the past that [they (PRP)| U.S. commanders in charge of planning for Middle East crises (NNS)] were capable of deploying as many as 300,000 troops 
And the U.S. is taking similar steps to ensure that [its (PRP$)| the U.S. (NNP)] naval force is adequate to carry out a blockade of Iraq and support a war if necessary 
Over the weekend , Pentagon officials confirmed reports that a fourth U.S. aircraft carrier the John F. Kennedy and [its (PRP$)| a fourth U.S. aircraft carrier the John F. Kennedy (NN)] powerful group of support ships could head for the Middle East within a few days 
Three other carriers and [their (PRP$)| Three other carriers (NNS)] escort vessels already are stationed within striking distance of Iraq or are steaming toward the area 
But unless the military situation changes drastically , military officials say , the most likely plan will be for the Kennedy to eventually replace the carrier Dwight D. Eisenhower , which has been on patrol since March and was scheduled to return to port before hostilities erupted in Kuwait
