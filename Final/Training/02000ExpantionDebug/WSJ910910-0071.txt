With hearings scheduled to begin today , the nomination of Judge Clarence Thomas to the U.S. Supreme Court has again raised questions concerning the responsibilities of senators and nominees during the confirmation process 
Some of Mr. Thomas's opponents have warned that they intend to make [him (PRP)| Judge Clarence Thomas to the U.S. Supreme Court (NNP)] answer very explicit questions about [his (PRP$)| Judge Clarence Thomas to the U.S. Supreme Court (NNP)] personal and philosophical beliefs , in order to avoid repeating the example of David Souter , the stealth candidate 
But if Mr. Thomas does refuse to answer explicit questions , it will not be merely Mr. Souter's example [he (PRP)| Judge Clarence Thomas to the U.S. Supreme Court (NNP)] will be following it will be that of the justice he has been nominated to replace , Thurgood Marshall 
Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D. , Ohio )has said that the Senate is entitled to a direct , categorical answer on Judge Thomas's stance on abortion , and on Roe v. Wade 
Thurgood Marshall's example makes [it (PRP)| Thurgood Marshall's example (NN)] plain , though , that Mr. Thomas may refuse to give that categorical answer 
During the Marshall hearings in 1967 , the issue of the day was not abortion but crime , and the most controversial case was Miranda v. Arizona 
Sen. John L. McClellan (D. , Ark. )pressed Mr. Marshall to reveal [his (PRP$)| that of the justice he has been nominated to replace , Thurgood Marshall (NNP)] opinion of the case 
Mr. Marshall refused , explaining that there were other cases pending on variations and interpretations of Miranda and that , if confirmed to the Supreme Court , [he (PRP)| Miranda (NNP)] would have to rule on those cases : On decisions that are certain to be re-examined in the court , it would be improper for [me (PRP)| that of the justice he has been nominated to replace , Thurgood Marshall (NNP)] to comment on [them (PRP)| Miranda v. Arizona (NNP)] in advance ... 
From all the hearings [I (PRP)| that of the justice he has been nominated to replace , Thurgood Marshall (NNP)] have read about , [it (PRP)| the U.S. Supreme Court (NNP)] has been considered and recognized as improper for a nominee to a judgeship to comment on a case [he (PRP)| a nominee (NN)] will have to pass on 
Sen. McClellan emphasized that [he (PRP)| Sen. John L. McClellan (D. , Ark. )(NNP)] did not want comments on a future case , but on a past case , Miranda 
But Mr. Marshall held firm , stating that future cases would be related to interpretations of Miranda , and that the issue of crime was still very controversial 
Sen. Sam Ervin (D. , N.C. )attempted to get Mr. Marshall to discuss the case law that preceded Miranda , in much the same way that Sen. Joe Biden (D. , Del. )attempted to persuade Judge Souter to comment on the right of privacy at issue in the abortion cases , by way of Griswold v. Connecticut 
But Mr. Marshall would not even remark on the 14 words in the Fifth Amendment concerning self-incrimination 
Sen. Ervin , exasperated , pointed out that since the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is so broad that a case on practically any issue might come before [it (PRP)| a case on practically any issue (NN)] , Mr. Marshall's theory meant that the committee would have a difficult time asking any questions about Mr. Marshall's judicial philosophy 
[It (PRP)| the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court (NN)] is a problem , Mr. Marshall said , though a problem for the committee , not the nominee 
In the end , Mr. Marshall would comment only on such long-decided cases as the Gibbons v. Ogden case of 1824 , which concerned issues of such vintage that they were no longer controversial 
Some of Mr. Thomas's detractors have openly worried that he seems too distant from his origins in the segregated South 
Eleanor Holmes Norton , delegate to Congress from the District of Columbia , said that [she (PRP)| Eleanor Holmes Norton (NNP)] hoped [he (PRP)| delegate to Congress from the District of Columbia (NN)] would bring to the bench [his (PRP$)| delegate to Congress from the District of Columbia (NN)] personal experience as a poor black man 
Harvard Law School's Derrick Bell fears that Mr. Thomas would look black but think white 
But such personal experiences are irrelevant to the work of a justice of the Supreme Court , according to Thurgood Marshall 
A judge is not permitted to use his own personal views under any circumstances , [he (PRP)| that of the justice he has been nominated to replace , Thurgood Marshall (NNP)] said , but if the particular decision-maker , whether [he (PRP)| the particular decision-maker (NN)] be judge or justice or magistrate , applies the Constitution to the facts and [it (PRP)| the Constitution (NNP)] comes out that way , that is inevitable 
Sometimes the outcome of a case is incidentally related to a justice's private views , but personal preferences can play no part in the decision-making process 
Such crusading zeal is inappropriate , despite the 1990 call of Sen. Paul Simon (D. , Ill. )for a nominee with fire in the belly 
There is nothing personal allowed , nothing personal , Mr. Marshall emphasized 
Justices shall not use their personal views , and indeed , they take an oath not to do so 
The intellectual leaders of the coalition that defeated the Bork nomination , notably Laurence Tribe in [his (PRP$)| Bork (NNP)] 1987 book , God Bless This Honorable Court , insisted that the Senate had the right and the responsibility to scrutinize a nominee's general political or judicial philosophy 
This issue was raised in the Marshall hearings too 
Clearly a senator may vote any way [he (PRP)| a senator (NN)] wishes on a nomination , and for any reason ; but not all votes nor all reasons are consistent with the duties of senators , and with the manner in which [they (PRP)| senators (NNS)] ought to behave 
This thought was expressed most eloquently by Sen. Edward Kennedy (D. , Mass. ), whose primary contribution to the Marshall hearings was elucidating the normative guidelines for senators 
Sen. Kennedy stressed a central point both in the committee room and before the full Senate : The Senate is to assess qualifications ; [it (PRP)| a central point (NN)] is not to examine political or judicial philosophy 
[We (PRP)| senators (NNS)] are not charged with the responsibility of approving a man to be associate justice of the Supreme Court only if [his (PRP$)| that of the justice he has been nominated to replace , Thurgood Marshall (NNP)] views always coincide with [our (PRP$)| senators (NNS)] own , Sen. Kennedy stated 
[We (PRP)| senators (NNS)] are not seeking a nominee for the Supreme Court who will express the majority view of the Senate on every given issue , or on a given issue of fundamental importance 
It was Sen. Kennedy's view that only the professional background of a nominee was relevant for senatorial consideration , not [his (PRP$)| a nominee (NN)] substantive views 
The question of ideological balance on the court was also raised in this context , and addressed by Sen. Roman Hruska (D. , Neb. )
Sen. Hruska had received letters stating that Mr. Marshall was too liberal for the Supreme Court , that [he (PRP)| that of the justice he has been nominated to replace , Thurgood Marshall (NNP)] would upset the balance between liberals and conservatives 
Sen. Hruska dismissed these fears as irrelevant 
The nominating power lies with the president of the United States ; and if it is his desire to appoint someone he considers a liberal , that is [his (PRP$)| the president of the United States (NN)] prerogative 
If [he (PRP)| the president of the United States (NN)] wants to nominate someone [he (PRP)| the president of the United States (NN)] considers a conservative , that is also [his (PRP$)| the president of the United States (NN)] prerogative 
The role of the Senate is to inquire into the integrity , the competence and the record of a man , not [his (PRP$)| a man (NN)] ideology 
Several other issues were brought up during the Marshall hearings that have a bearing on Judge Thomas's case 
Sen. Kennedy believed that because Mr. Marshall had been moved through the Judiciary Committee before , the Senate could move expeditiously ahead with [his (PRP$)| that of the justice he has been nominated to replace , Thurgood Marshall (NNP)] confirmation 
Mr. Thomas , too , has been previously approved by the committee 
Mr. Marshall had been accused of having communist ties , in part because in one case [he (PRP)| that of the justice he has been nominated to replace , Thurgood Marshall (NNP)] cited a work by Herbert Aptheker , a leading U.S. communist theoretician 
Committee Chairman James Eastland (D. , Miss. )raised this issue , but only to allow Mr. Marshall to clarify the facts , and to state that [he (PRP)| Committee Chairman James Eastland (D. , Miss. )(NNP)] was not a communist 
Mr. Thomas's supposed ties to Louis Farrakhan seem entitled to equal treatment 
Finally , the fact that Mr. Marshall was black was treated as noteworthy , but not determinative 
In the case of Judge Thomas , blackness ought to be regarded the same way 
The fact that Mr. Thomas's judicial views are not the same as those of Thurgood Marshall is a reflection of the increasingly pluralistic nature of black society , but hardly an issue worthy of senatorial consideration 
As the second black American to serve on the Supreme Court , Judge Thomas will shoulder many responsibilities ; not because [he (PRP)| Judge Clarence Thomas to the U.S. Supreme Court (NNP)] is black , but because [he (PRP)| Judge Clarence Thomas to the U.S. Supreme Court (NNP)] will hold a lofty office
