Britain and the United States have kept their hopes of issuing mining licenses in the Antarctic alive by refusing to accept proposals to turn the continent into a wildlife reserve 
Twelve days of talks here among the 39 Antarctic Treaty nations , discussions dominated by the mining issue , broke up Friday night with a wide division between the pro- and anti-mining nations 
Australia and France had proposed that Antarctica be turned into a wilderness park and that the Minerals Convention of 1988 , which took six years to negotiate , be scrapped 
Britain and the United States refused to discuss this proposal and insisted that the conference should talk about implementing the convention and discuss clauses that would apportion liability in the case of mining pollution 
The Minerals Convention creates a framework for mining under strict environmental guidelines 
At the end of the conference , it was decided to hold another two meetings in Chile next year 
One would discuss comprehensive environmental issues for the Antarctic and the second would talk about accident liability clauses for minerals 
Both sides refused to compromise but were aware that walking out of the meeting would have destroyed the Antarctic Treaty system that has controlled the region for 30 years , prevented armed conflict and promoted scientific cooperation 
John Heap , head of Britain's delegation , said London is not prepared to discuss the wilderness park idea if [it (PRP)| the wilderness park idea (NN)] excludes all mining 
The last great wilderness is the size of the United States and Europe put together , Heap said 
Is [it (PRP)| The last great wilderness (NN)] inevitable that a mine site somewhere in Antarctica would despoil all Antarctica ? 
[I (PRP)| John Heap (NNP)] do not believe [it (PRP)| The last great wilderness (NN)] is 
Chief U.S. representative Tucker Scully said that the meeting had agreed on other urgent practical steps to protect the environment , including tighter rules on marine pollution and waste disposal 
Litter from the 9,000 scientists stationed on the icecap during the summer , plus an estimated 3,000 tourists each year , has already started to pollute the coasts where both people and wildlife cluster 
French officials said the conference had been a failure because Britain and the United States had refused to discuss their proposals 
Jim Barnes , from the Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition , representing 300 environmental organizations , said that the wilderness park proposals were still on the table , something [he (PRP)| Jim Barnes (NNP)] said gives [us (PRP)| 300 environmental organizations (NNS)] more time to push [our (PRP$)| 300 environmental organizations (NNS)] case 
The tide is running [our (PRP$)| 300 environmental organizations (NNS)] way , Barnes said 
[We (PRP)| 300 environmental organizations (NNS)] believe the minerals regime will never be implemented now , although [it (PRP)| the minerals regime (NN)] may take a long time to kill
