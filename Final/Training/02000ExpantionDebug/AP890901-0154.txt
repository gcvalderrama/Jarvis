A naval commander who had observed the USS Vincennes in the Persian Gulf said the ship had no good reason for shooting down an Iranian civilian airliner , killing all 290 aboard 
The unusually candid article by Cmdr. David R. Carlson in the U.S. Naval Institute Proceedings magazine this month said others had remarked on the agressive behavior of the Vincennes , which had been dubbed robo cruiser 
Carlson , commander of the USS Sides , a frigate that was on the scene when the USS Vincennes shot down the Airbus on July 3 , 1988 , clearly put the blame on actions taken by the ship and disputed any notion of self-defense 
No profit has come from the pathetic postincident attempts to place the blame on the victims , [he (PRP)| Commander Carlson's (NNP)] wrote 
View [it (PRP)| No profit (NN)] as you will , Iran Air Flight 655 was shot down for no good reason 
Having watched the performance of the Vincennes for a month before the incident , my impression was clearly that an atmosphere of restraint was not her long suit 
Her actions appeared to be consistently aggressive , and had become a topic of wardroom conversation 
Capt. Will Rogers , skipper of the Vincennes at the time , said Carlson's assessment was subjective and not in line with the Navy's conclusions 
The Navy investigated the events of July 3 , 1988 , in excruciating detail and published [its (PRP$)| the Navy's (NNP)] findings in the Fogarty Report , Rogers said in a statement issued by the Navy in San Diego , where [he (PRP)| Will Rogers (NNP)] is stationed 
Commander Carlson's comments in the magazine article are [his (PRP$)| Commander Carlson's (NNP)] personal opinions of the Airbus incident , [he (PRP)| Will Rogers (NNP)] said 
[I (PRP)| Will Rogers (NNP)] fully stand behind the Navy report and the performance of [my (PRP$)| Will Rogers (NNP)] crew 
Navy spokesman David L. Dillon in San Diego said that the magazine is not part of the Navy 
[It (PRP)| the Navy's (NNP)] is published by the Naval Institute , a private self-supported non-profit professional society and [it (PRP)| the Navy's (NNP)] is a forum for people to express personal opinions and assertions in various articles related to Navy issues , but the Naval Institute is not part of the U.S. government , so [his (PRP$)| Navy spokesman David L. Dillon in San Diego (NNP)] comments are [his (PRP$)| Navy spokesman David L. Dillon in San Diego (NNP)] own personal opinion , [he (PRP)| Will Rogers (NNP)] said 
Carlson suggests the crew of the Vincennes wanted to prove the capability of the ship's Aegis missile-defense system in the Persian Gulf 
On the day of the incident , Carlson said , a crewman informed [him (PRP)| Commander Carlson's (NNP)] that the Vincennes had classified the plane as an Iranian F-14 fighter 
[I (PRP)| Commander Carlson's (NNP)] was also prepared to deal with an air threat , but in all honesty did not perceive one , Carlson said 
According to Carlson , the event started with the Vincenneshelicopter drawing fire from Iranian speedboats , which [he (PRP)| Commander Carlson's (NNP)] claims were only warning shots 
The Vincennes saw an opportunity for action , and pressed hard for Commander Middle East Force to give permission to fire , Carlson said 
The tragedy was avoidable , and [we (PRP)| Iranian speedboats (NNS)] must learn from [it (PRP)| The tragedy (NN)] , [he (PRP)| Commander Carlson's (NNP)] said 
A review of the facts is in order , Carlson wrote 
When the decision was made to shoot down the Airbus , the airliner was climbing , not diving ; [it (PRP)| the decision (NN)] was showing the proper identification friend or foe ... The Vincennes was never under attack by Iranian aircraft 
A naval investigator told Congress last September that a series of errors caused by stress , including misinterpreting electronic data , caused the mistaken attack on the airliner 
Rear Adm. William M. Fogarty , who headed the Navy's investigating team , said the captain of the Vincennes , Will Rogers III , ordered the ship's missiles fired in the mistaken belief the airliner was an Iranian F-14 fighter plane 
Carlson , in [his (PRP$)| Commander Carlson's (NNP)] article , puts some of the blame on [himself (PRP)| Commander Carlson's (NNP)] 
[I (PRP)| Commander Carlson's (NNP)] wondered aloud in disbelief , but [I (PRP)| Commander Carlson's (NNP)] did not do the one thing that might have helped , [he (PRP)| Commander Carlson's (NNP)] wrote 
[I (PRP)| Commander Carlson's (NNP)] did not push for a reevaluation 
Had [I (PRP)| Commander Carlson's (NNP)] done so , the information might have come forward quickly enough to allow [me (PRP)| Commander Carlson's (NNP)] to attempt to dissuade the Vincennes from shooting
