Federal regulators charged that President Bush's son Neil engaged in personal dishonesty as a director of the failed Silverado Banking Savings & Loan Assn. and sought to bar him from future service as a thrift director , according to a confidential memorandum disclosed Tuesday at a congressional hearing 
The memo , prepared early this year by the enforcement staff of the federal Office of Thrift Supervision , was never formally issued as a complaint against Bush , and the agency eventually moved against [him (PRP)| President Bush's (NNP)] on lesser charges 
The allegations contained in the OTS memorandum provide the most detailed account made public about the role of the President's son in the financial demise of Silverado , one of the biggest failures among hundreds of S&L insolvencies 
Neil Bush was not present at Tuesday's hearing , but in previous appearances [he (PRP)| President Bush's (NNP)] has strongly denied any wrongdoing in connection with [his (PRP$)| President Bush's (NNP)] tenure as a Silverado director 
[He (PRP)| President Bush's (NNP)] is challenging in an administrative proceeding the government's allegations that [he (PRP)| President Bush's (NNP)] violated thrift rules 
Bush willfully breached [his (PRP$)| President Bush's (NNP)] duty as a director by failing to inform the board that a major borrower at the S&L , Kenneth M. Good , was going to pay $ 3 million for an 80 % interest in Bush's oil exploration company , the OTS document says 
About the same time Good was buying control of Bush's firm , the Silverado board agreed to forgive $ 11 million in loans and obligations owed by Good to the S&L because he allegedly could not pay his bills , the memorandum states 
Bush abstained from voting on Silverado's loans to Good , but the OTS document said [he (PRP)| President Bush's (NNP)] did not disclose [his (PRP$)| President Bush's (NNP)] business relations with Good as required by federal regulations affecting thrift directors 
Good and another investor in Bush's firm , William L. Walters , ultimately defaulted on more than $ 130 million in loans at Denver-based Silverado 
The cleanup of the institution , which was seized by federal regulators last December , could cost taxpayers as much as $ 1 billion 
Good , appearing in response to a subpoena by the House Banking , Finance and Urban Affairs Committee , defended the President's son 
At no time did [I (PRP)| Kenneth M. Good (NNP)] ask or expect Neil to influence or vote on any of the transactions that were negotiated with Silverado management , [he (PRP)| Kenneth M. Good (NNP)] testified 
Good said [he (PRP)| Kenneth M. Good (NNP)] was shocked by the personal attacks that continue to be made upon (Bush )with regard to [his (PRP$)| (Bush )with regard (NNP)] role in Silverado 
[I (PRP)| Kenneth M. Good (NNP)] can testify without hesitation that Neil is a man of absolute integrity ... Rep. Frank Annunzio (D-Ill )
, who obtained the OTS document , said the office and [its (PRP$)| the federal Office of Thrift Supervision (NNP)] predecessor , under Republican control for nearly the past 10 years , is clearly not an agency designed to make political hay by going after the son of the President of the United States 
Serious charges have been leveled against Neil Bush , Annunzio said 
Is that the end of the case ? 
That the taxpayers are going to have to pick up a $ 1-billion tab without ever knowing whether Neil Bush was right or wrong ? 
Good and other key figures in Silverado's downfall testified in the third day of Banking Committee hearings on the S&L , where Neil Bush served as a director from August , 1985 , until August , 1988 
Democrats have tried to link the President's son to greedy real estate developers who defaulted on loans from the thrift , and Republicans have defended [him (PRP)| Republicans (NNS)] as an honest , if occasionally naive , young man 
When Bush left the Silverado board in August , the Colorado savings and loan commissioner had all but sounded the death warning when [he (PRP)| President Bush's (NNP)] told Silverado that [it (PRP)| the failed Silverado Banking Savings & Loan Assn. (NNP)] would have to raise $ 62 million of new capital or face a closure order , committee Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex )
said 
When the state official moved to enforce [his (PRP$)| the state official (NN)] order and attempted to shut Silverado in October , the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. in Washington quickly ordered a two-month delay , putting off any action until after the presidential election 
Kermit Mowbray , serving as the chief regulator for the region , told the committee that [he (PRP)| Kermit Mowbray (NNP)] received a phone call from [his (PRP$)| Kermit Mowbray (NNP)] superiors in Washington directing a postponement in closing Silverado 
On Nov. 9 , the day after President Bush won the election , Mowbray submitted a formal recommendation that Silverado be placed into receivership , and the government took control on Dec. 9 
In response to questions , Mowbray said [he (PRP)| Kermit Mowbray (NNP)] did not think the postponement was based on political considerations 
[He (PRP)| Kermit Mowbray (NNP)] said [he (PRP)| Kermit Mowbray (NNP)] had never been subjected to any political pressure or influence in the case 
In the memo , the federal regulatorscriticism of Neil Bush focused on [his (PRP$)| President Bush's (NNP)] failure to disclose [his (PRP$)| President Bush's (NNP)] business ties with Walters and Good , major borrowers at Silverado 
Walters invested $ 150,000 in JNB , Bush's oil exploration firm , providing half of its original capital 
Bush later voted to approve loans to Walters and [his (PRP$)| William L. Walters (NNP)] companies , although [he (PRP)| William L. Walters (NNP)] abstained from voting on loans to Good 
The enforcement staff's document , prepared in January , named Bush , along with former Silverado Chairman Michael Wise , Director James Metz , Executive Vice President Russell Murray , and outside counsel Ronald Jacobs 
[It (PRP)| The enforcement staff's document (NN)] said [their (PRP$)| former Silverado Chairman Michael Wise , Director James Metz , Executive Vice President Russell Murray , and outside counsel (NNP)] conduct involved personal dishonesty , or demonstrated a willful or continuing disregard for the safety or soundness of Silverado 
The document called for a hearing to decide on issuance of an order barring the four men from ever working again for federally insured institutions without prior government approval 
The proposed prohibition was never issued by the Office of Thrift Supervision 
Gonzalez noted that Wise and Metz , and two other former Silverado executives , chief operating officer Richard K. Vandapool and chief financial officer Robert M. Lewis , signed consent orders accepting the prohibition 
The OTS filed a lesser complaint against Neil Bush , seeking a cease-and-desist order that would direct [him (PRP)| President Bush's (NNP)] to refrain from committing any future violations of disclosure rules 
An administrative law judge at the agency will conduct a hearing later this year to determine whether to proceed against Bush 
There was not sufficient evidence against Bush to seek a prohibition order , according to OTS officials 
The pending case against Bush has thrown a bright spotlight on the obligation of boards of directors to meet their fiduciary responsibility , Gonzalez said 
This responsibility is critical to the safety and soundness of any institution , and [it (PRP)| their fiduciary responsibility (NN)] is the first line of defense against raids on the insurance funds and the taxpayers
