HOT SPRINGS , Ark. [It (PRP)| the summer of 1969 (NN)] was the summer of 1969 
The Vietnam War was raging 
And young Bill Clinton did not want to be drafted 
Mr. Clinton was in a bind because although [he (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] was studying as a Rhodes scholar at England's Oxford University , graduate-school deferments had been ended in 1967 
But [he (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] found an out : [He (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] said [he (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] would join a reserve-officers training program at the University of Arkansas while [he (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] attended law school there 
In fact , [he (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] never joined the program , or even attended the law school 
But [it (PRP)| a reserve-officers training program (NN)] exempted [him (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] from the draft during September and October of 1969 , the critical two months when [he (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] expected to be called into service 
By October , [he (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] had a change of heart and subjected [himself (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] to possible induction 
But by then the draft lottery was about to take effect and he drew a lottery number high enough that he never was called 
Many young men with Mr. Clinton's educational background found ways to avoid military service during the Vietnam War 
But the issues raised by [his (PRP$)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] conduct remain relevant for several reasons 
The question of whether Vice President Dan Quayle used influence to get into the Indiana National Guard in 1969 and thus avoid Vietnam stirred a debate in the last campaign , and Republicans no doubt will demand that Mr. Clinton's record receive equal scrutiny 
Moreover , people directly involved with Mr. Clinton's draft status contradict [his (PRP$)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] version of what happened 
Even back in 1969 , Bill Clinton was not just any young man 
Though [he (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] had been classified 1-A available for military service when [he (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] graduated from Georgetown University in the spring of 1968 , as a Rhodes scholar [he (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] was the pride of [his (PRP$)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] community 
So instead of calling [him (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] right away , the local draft board gave [him (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] a reprieve to allow [him (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] to continue his studies at Oxford 
As old as [he (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] was , [he (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] would have been at the top of the list to be drafted , says 84-year-old Opal Ellis , the draft board's executive secretary 
But , [she (PRP)| Opal Ellis (NNP)] explains , we were proud to have a Hot Springs boy with a Rhodes scholarship , and so the board was very lenient with [him (PRP)| a Hot Springs boy with a Rhodes scholarship (NN)] ... 
We gave [him (PRP)| a Hot Springs boy with a Rhodes scholarship (NN)] more than [he (PRP)| a Hot Springs boy with a Rhodes scholarship (NN)] was entitled to 
Mr. Clinton's own memory is even more precise 
[He (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] says the board told [him (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] that [he (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] would not be drafted until the fall of 1969 , a year and a half after being designated 1-A 
The board said , [You (PRP)| Opal Ellis (NNP)] will probably be called in the fall , September or October -LCB- of 1969 -RCB- , [he (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] says in an interview 
So when Mr. Clinton returned home after [his (PRP$)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] first year at Oxford , [he (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] knew the draft was imminent 
Mrs. Ellis , a Republican who held her civil-service position for 20 years , alleges that [he (PRP)| a Republican who held her civil-service position for 20 years (NNP)] went in and told [me (PRP)| Opal Ellis (NNP)] [he (PRP)| a Republican who held her civil-service position for 20 years (NNP)] was too well educated to go 
[She (PRP)| Opal Ellis (NNP)] says [he (PRP)| a Republican who held her civil-service position for 20 years (NNP)] told [her (PRP)| Opal Ellis (NNP)] that [he (PRP)| a Republican who held her civil-service position for 20 years (NNP)] was going to fix [my (PRP$)| Opal Ellis (NNP)] wagon -LCB- and -RCB- pull every string [he (PRP)| a Republican who held her civil-service position for 20 years (NNP)] could think of 
But Mr. Clinton says [he (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] does not recall having any confrontation with Mrs. Ellis , and [he (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] strongly denies using strongarm tactics to avoid the draft ; anyone who says he did , [he (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] says , has , at best , a faulty memory 
In any case , Mr. Clinton says [he (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] decided to , in [his (PRP$)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] words , look around for another option 
[He (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] opposed the war , but if [he (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] had to serve [he (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] preferred to be an officer rather than a draftee , so [he (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] sought an officer's training program to join 
[He (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] took the Air Force officer's exam , [he (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] says , but failed because of a vision defect 
[He (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] also took the naval officer's test , but failed because of a hearing problem 
([He (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] had already taken [his (PRP$)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] draft physical , and neither problem prevented [him (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] from passing )
Then , as [his (PRP$)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] expected draft deadline loomed , Mr. Clinton met Col. Eugene Holmes , an Army ROTC recruiter at the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville 
Both men say Mr. Clinton agreed orally to join the Army officer's program at the law school there 
And based on that consent , the Hot Springs draft board , on Aug. 7 , 1969 , reclassified Mr. Clinton from 1-A to 1-D a draft deferment that a spokesman for the Selective Service System says was only for people who had joined a reserve unit , or who were students taking military training , such as the ROTC 
But Mr. Clinton never joined the training program and for that matter , never even enrolled at the university 
[He (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] had one more year to go at Oxford , and intended to complete that work 
And when [he (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] finally returned to the U.S. in 1970 , [he (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] enrolled not at Arkansas , but at Yale Law School 
Mr. Clinton says [he (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] indeed planned to attend Arkansas , after [he (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] completed [his (PRP$)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] studies in England 
[He (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] says the university informally accepted [him (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] based on [his (PRP$)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] academic record , though [he (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] never formally applied there 
A Clinton aide says the governor believes that [he (PRP)| the governor (NN)] applied to Yale during his second year at Oxford 
But even Virginia Kelley , Mr. Clinton's mother , says [she (PRP)| Mr. Clinton's mother (NN)] does not remember [him (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] planning to attend Arkansas 
That is very strange , [she (PRP)| Mr. Clinton's mother (NN)] says 
[I (PRP)| Mr. Clinton's mother (NN)] was under the impression when [he (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] came home from Oxford that [he (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] was going to go to Yale 
Mr. Holmes , who counts [himself (PRP)| Eugene Holmes (NNP)] as a political independent , says Mr. Clinton's true plans were not ever made plain to [him (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] ; [he (PRP)| Eugene Holmes (NNP)] thought Mr. Clinton's arrival was imminent 
[I (PRP)| Eugene Holmes (NNP)] thought [he (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] was going to finish a month or two in England and then come back to the University of Arkansas , [he (PRP)| Eugene Holmes (NNP)] says , adding of the 1-D deferment : [I (PRP)| Eugene Holmes (NNP)] could not have done [it (PRP)| the 1-D deferment (NN)] for a year 
That would not have been ethical 
[He (PRP)| Eugene Holmes (NNP)] charges that Bill Clinton was able to manipulate things so that [he (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] did not have to go in 
Mr. Clinton disputes Mr. Holmes's version of what happened 
[He (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] says Mr. Holmes offered [him (PRP)| Eugene Holmes (NNP)] the ROTC deferment immediately and also encouraged [him (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] to return for [his (PRP$)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] final year at Oxford 
[I (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] remember talking to Holmes one day , and [he (PRP)| Eugene Holmes (NNP)] said : You know , you ca not go to summer camp until next summer anyway 
Why do not [you just go back (PRP)| Eugene Holmes (NNP)] and do your second year in England ? 
Mr. Clinton recalls 
In any event , Mr. Clinton had his deferment in time to cover the very period September and October of 1969 that the draft board had earlier told him was when he would probably be conscripted 
Asked whether the deferment was proper , Mr. Clinton says : [I (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] did not know what the rules were 
All [I (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] can tell you is what they told [me (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] 
But [he (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] says [he (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] soon had doubts about the morality of [it (PRP)| his deferment in time (NN)] 
[I (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] had already had one year , [I (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] had high school classmates who were already dead , [he (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] says 
[I (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] decided it was an inappropriate thing to do 
So Mr. Clinton informed Col. Holmes that [he (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] would not be joining the ROTC after all 
Mr. Clinton recalls that [he (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] notified Col. Holmes that [he (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] would not participate in ROTC in September or early October 
Col. Holmes has trouble remembering , though [he (PRP)| Col. Eugene Holmes (NNP)] thinks [it (PRP)| Army ROTC (NNP)] might have been a month or two months from the time of their August conversation 
But Mr. Holmes says [he (PRP)| Eugene Holmes (NNP)] was angered to learn of the change of plans , and moved to revoke Mr. Clinton's draft deferment 
On Oct. 30 , 1969 , Mr. Clinton was reclassified 1-A 
Ethically [I (PRP)| Eugene Holmes (NNP)] think [he (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] should have stayed in ROTC , Mr. Holmes says 
[He (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] would given [his (PRP$)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] word and was backing out 
Having averted the fall draft , Mr. Clinton says [he (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] was fully prepared to be conscripted 
But [he (PRP)| young Bill Clinton (NNP)] was never called 
A new draft lottery system , based on dates of birth , was enacted into law on Nov. 26 
And on Dec. 1 , 1969 , Mr. Clinton got number 311 
No one with a number higher than 195 was called , according to the Selective Service System
