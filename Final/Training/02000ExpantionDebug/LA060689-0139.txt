In this town of reproach and recrimination , it seems increasingly clear that publishing well is the best revenge 
In that spirit , one of the latest to join the parade of let-me-tell-you-my-side authors is Robert H. Bork , the former appeals court judge who was nominated to the Supreme Court by President Reagan but was rejected by the Senate 
[His (PRP$)| Robert H. Bork (NNP)] version of the events is contained in The Tempting of America , to be published in November by the Free Press 
But at a preview-of-coming-attractions press briefing at the annual convention of American Booksellers Assn. in Washington over the weekend , Bork the target of the first all-out , national political campaign to defeat a Supreme Court nominee insisted that [his (PRP$)| Robert H. Bork (NNP)] book was more about the general tendency to run law into politics than about [his (PRP$)| Robert H. Bork (NNP)] own particular unhappy experience 
[His (PRP$)| Robert H. Bork (NNP)] unsuccessful bid for a seat on the nation's highest court forms only a part of [his (PRP$)| Robert H. Bork (NNP)] book , Bork said 
The contentious debate over his nomination is simply an example of what [he (PRP)| Robert H. Bork (NNP)] sees as this country's increasing , dangerous tendency to achieve political responses through the courts 
The consequence , Bork writes , is a steady erosion of the most basic American right , the right of the people to govern themselves when the Constitution does not say otherwise 
By politicizing the courts , Bork elaborated , Americans have eaten away at the people's right to legislate the laws we want to live by 
No better example comes to mind , Bork said , than the ongoing furor over abortion 
As a federal judge in Washington , [he (PRP)| a federal judge in Washington (NN)] recalled , [my (PRP$)| a federal judge in Washington (NN)] office overlooked Pennsylvania Avenue 
Twice a year , there was a march , once by pro-abortionists and once by anti-abortionists 
But as the protesters proceeded up Capitol Hill , [they (PRP)| the protesters (NNS)] went straight past both houses of Congress with nary a pause , and straight to the Supreme Court , Bork said 
So far as [they (PRP)| the protesters (NNS)] were concerned , for [their (PRP$)| the protesters (NNS)] purposes , the Supreme Court was [their (PRP$)| the protesters (NNS)] branch 
Both sides , Bork said , regard the court as in large part not a legal institution , but a political body 
To Bork , that means that a major heresy has entered into the American political system 
The constitutional sacrilege , Bork contends , is the introduction of the denial that judges are bound by law 
Bork's constitutional expertise was one of the qualities that Reagan said figured strongly in [his (PRP$)| Reagan (NNP)] decision to nominate Bork for the Supreme Court and to support Bork's decision to tough out [his (PRP$)| Robert H. Bork , the former appeals court judge who was nominated to the Supreme Court by President Reagan but was rejected by the Senate (NNP)] bitter , ultimately unsuccessful five-month fight for the position in 1987 
But his rigidness and his archconservative views frightened many people , inside and outside the Senate 
Many feared his effect on Supreme Court decisions because [they (PRP)| his rigidness and his archconservative views (NN)] said he already was too arrogant when contending that his interpretations of the law were the ones that best matched the original intent of the framers of the Constitution 
The Founders of this nation thought the primary means of assuring [our (PRP$)| his rigidness and his archconservative views (NN)] liberty was not the courts , Bork said this weekend , but rather the assignment of different functions to different branches of government 
Whereas the Constitution specified that laws were to be made by legislators who were elected by the people , not judges appointed by the President , Bork said , a lot of Americans now simply assume that the courts should produce results [they (PRP)| legislators who were elected by the people (NNS)] like rather than sticking to the Constitution 
The Great Temptation Though without its subtitle , The Political Seduction of the Law , a book called The Tempting of America does sound rather like a collection of regional dessert recipes , Bork maintains that mass assumption explains the great temptation , expecting political results from the courts 
In [his (PRP$)| The Great Temptation Though without its subtitle , The Political Seduction of the Law , a book called The Tempting of America (NNP)] own confirmation hearings , many senators wanted political results from the courts , Bork said 
[They (PRP)| many senators (NNS)] had what [they (PRP)| many senators (NNS)] accused President Reagan of having , and that is , [they (PRP)| many senators (NNS)] had a litmus test 
The angry sessions were marked by a level of communication that was not very high , Bork said 
We talked right past each other 
On the matter of Bork's leanings on possible Supreme Court action on the abortion issue , [I (PRP)| Robert H. Bork (NNP)] was told by two Republican senators that [they (PRP)| two Republican senators (NNS)] would vote against [me (PRP)| Robert H. Bork (NNP)] because [I (PRP)| Robert H. Bork (NNP)] might vote to overturn Roe against Wade , Bork said 
[I (PRP)| Robert H. Bork (NNP)] was told by two Democratic senators that [they (PRP)| two Democratic senators (NNS)] would vote against [me (PRP)| Robert H. Bork (NNP)] because [I (PRP)| Robert H. Bork (NNP)] might not vote to overturn Roe against Wade 
But this tempting , or political manipulation of the courts , long predated [his (PRP$)| Robert H. Bork (NNP)] attempt to secure a seat on the Supreme Court , Bork said 
It started at the very beginning of the Republic , [he (PRP)| Robert H. Bork (NNP)] said 
Not Just a Liberal Sin Nor is [it a liberal sin (PRP)| a Liberal Sin (NNP)] , [he (PRP)| Robert H. Bork (NNP)] went on 
Conservative courts have done the same thing 
But [it (PRP)| the same thing (NN)] is illegitimate no matter who does [it (PRP)| the same thing (NN)] 
In large part , Bork blasts law schools for undermining what [he (PRP)| Robert H. Bork (NNP)] describes as constitutional legitimacy 
With a wave of a beefy arm , Bork asserted , The majority opinion in the law schools today is that the Constitution is not law 
As [he (PRP)| Robert H. Bork (NNP)] writes in [his (PRP$)| Robert H. Bork (NNP)] book , A new generation of law school professors and other elite groups no longer trust the people enough to let [them (PRP)| law school professors and other elite groups (NNS)] decide what our laws should be 
Among consequences of this trend toward politicization of the courts , Bork said , is that we may expect (judicial )confirmation battles that are increasingly bitter 
We may also expect a constitutional law that lurches suddenly in one direction or the other 
Constitutional law , in short , Bork said , has come to be seen as a political weapon 
Book on Legal Theory Now a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington , Bork said [he (PRP)| a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute (NN)] has devoted the last 1Â 1/2 years to research , lectures and to writing [his (PRP$)| a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute (NN)] book 
Much of [it (PRP)| Legal Theory Now a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute (NNP)] was turned out aboard airplanes on [his (PRP$)| a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute (NN)] laptop computer 
At bottom , [he (PRP)| a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute (NN)] said , his new book is about legal theory 
Nevertheless , [it (PRP)| his new book (NN)] will tell [his (PRP$)| a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute (NN)] side of the story of [his (PRP$)| a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute (NN)] battle with the Senate 
Of course , Bork declared with the same bombastic assertiveness that became familiar in the lengthy confirmation hearings 
Well , [I (PRP)| Robert H. Bork (NNP)] would not want anyone else to tell [it (PRP)| the same bombastic assertiveness that became familiar in the lengthy confirmation hearings (NN)] , would [I (PRP)| Robert H. Bork (NNP)] ? 
Bork challenged 
[His (PRP$)| Robert H. Bork (NNP)] furry eyebrows were arched decisively 
End of discussion
