WASHINGTON Embattled White House Chief of Staff John Sununu , fighting for [his (PRP$)| White House Chief of Staff John Sununu (NNP)] political survival , has a rare bit of good news : While Americans generally do not approve of [his (PRP$)| White House Chief of Staff John Sununu (NNP)] actions , most do not think [he (PRP)| White House Chief of Staff John Sununu (NNP)] should resign 
In a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll , voters were asked whether charges of inappropriate use of government and corporate transportation by Mr. Sununu are so serious that [he (PRP)| the combative Mr. Sununu (NNP)] should resign 
More than 80 % of the voters surveyed were aware of the flap , and among [them (PRP)| the voters surveyed (NNS)] , a clear majority , 58 % , said the assertions are not serious enough for [him (PRP)| the combative Mr. Sununu (NNP)] to resign 
Just 33 % said [he (PRP)| the combative Mr. Sununu (NNP)] should quit 
The remainder either did not have an opinion or refused to answer 
Even among Democrats , 49 % did not think [he (PRP)| Democrats (NNPS)] should resign , while 42 % thought [he (PRP)| Democrats (NNPS)] should 
That hardly means Mr. Sununu is out of the woods , of course 
Though President Bush says Mr. Sununu's job is safe for now , the ruckus over the chief of staff's extensive use of government and corporate jets and cars has brought to the surface a host of Sununu enemies who are likely to keep gunning for [his (PRP$)| President Bush (NNP)] demise 
And while voters are not clamoring for Mr. Sununu's head , [they (PRP)| voters (NNS)] have formed a more negative impression of [him (PRP)| the combative Mr. Sununu (NNP)] 
The survey found that 41 % of voters have a negative view of the chief of staff , while just 10 % said [they (PRP)| voters (NNS)] have positive feelings 
Last October , the view was not so clearly negative 
Then , just 20 % said [they (PRP)| voters (NNS)] had negative feelings about Mr. Sununu , while 18 % reported positive feelings 
The Journal/NBC poll was conducted jointly by Democratic pollster Peter Hart and Republican pollster Robert Teeter 
[They (PRP)| Democratic pollster Peter Hart and Republican pollster Robert Teeter (NNP)] canvassed 1,006 registered voters by telephone from last Saturday through Tuesday , a period when the latest flap over Mr. Sununu's failure to inform the White House counsel's office accurately about the procurement of a corporate jet [he (PRP)| the White House counsel's (NN)] used to attend a Chicago fund-raiser was in full swing 
The poll's findings are likely to fuel arguments by Mr. Sununu's supporters that the controversy over [his (PRP$)| the combative Mr. Sununu (NNP)] travel is not being taken as seriously in the country at large as [it (PRP)| a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll (NN)] is inside Washington 
Mr. Sununu admitted that [he (PRP)| the combative Mr. Sununu (NNP)] made mistakes in using government planes and [his (PRP$)| the combative Mr. Sununu (NNP)] White House car for personal and political business , and [he (PRP)| the combative Mr. Sununu (NNP)] has adopted a low profile 
[He (PRP)| the combative Mr. Sununu (NNP)] appears to be calculating that [he (PRP)| the combative Mr. Sununu (NNP)] can ride out the storm 
The criticism is not likely to stop , though 
Enemies of the combative Mr. Sununu are trying to capitalize on [his (PRP$)| the combative Mr. Sununu (NNP)] weakened position to hurt [him (PRP)| the combative Mr. Sununu (NNP)] , largely through anonymous criticisms and attacks 
Some administration aides and Republican strategists are arguing , for instance , that [he (PRP)| Republican (NNP)] now is a clear political liability and should be pushed aside before Mr. Bush's re-election campaign gets into full swing 
There also is quiet lobbying against Mr. Sununu by Israel's supporters , who long have been suspicious of him because of his links to Arab-American groups and his refusal as governor of New Hampshire to endorse a proclamation condemning a United Nations vote equating Zionism with racism 
Israel backers , for instance , have been circulating a 1988 proclamation [he (PRP)| Mr. Sununu by Israel's supporters , who long have been suspicious of him because of his links to Arab-American groups and his refusal as governor of New Hampshire to endorse a proclamation condemning a United Nations vote equating Zionism with racism (NNP)] signed as governor honoring the crew of the Liberty , a U.S. ship attacked by Israeli forces under murky circumstances during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war
