Attorneys for Mr. Milken dismiss the suggestion as absurd and say Mr. Milken's potential liability wo not be nearly so extensive 
While some shareholder attorneys routinely file multimillion-dollar suits whenever a takeover is announced or the market drops , the suits against Mr. Milken seem to be much more likely to succeed than most 
Consider : Mr. Milken's guilty plea to six felony counts Tuesday makes [it (PRP)| Tuesday (NNP)] impossible for [him (PRP)| Mr. Milken (NNP)] to claim in civil cases that [he (PRP)| Mr. Milken (NNP)] was guilty of no market fraud 
In each case , the former junk bond impresario will be viewed as a convicted felon 
So much evidence against him has already been gathered by federal prosecutors and the Securities and Exchange Commission , much of which will eventually become available to shareholder lawyers , that plaintiffsattorneys will have to do relatively little sleuthing of [their (PRP$)| plaintiffsattorneys (NNS)] own 
While Mr. Milken did not plead guilty to any racketeering counts , recent court cases have made [it (PRP)| So much evidence against him (NN)] increasingly easy to show a so-called pattern of racketeering in civil cases 
Shareholders have sued Mr. Milken under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law , and RICO damages are automatically tripled 
The SEC's funds to compensate victims of market wrongdoing by Mr. Milken , Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and convicted abritrager Ivan F. Boesky , while stocked with more than $ 600 million , can not be used to pay tripled damages or punitive damages 
Thus , any judgment against Mr. Milken above mere compensatory damages would have to come out of [his (PRP$)| Mr. Milken above mere compensatory damages (NNP)] own pocket 
Drexel was Mr. Milken's former employer 
The securities firm has filed for bankruptcy-court protection 
All of this sounds like good news to Richard Greenfield , one of the nation's top shareholder lawyers 
As [he (PRP)| Richard Greenfield (NNP)] eagerly scanned the early wire reports of the plea Tuesday , Mr. Greenfield said Mr. Milken should seriously contemplate filing for bankruptcy-court protection 
[It (PRP)| Mr. Milken's guilty plea to six felony (NN)] is a very real possibility , said Mr. Greenfield , who has filed several cases against Mr. Milken 
If [I (PRP)| Richard Greenfield (NNP)] were in [his (PRP$)| Mr. Milken (NNP)] shoes , [I (PRP)| Richard Greenfield (NNP)] would want to start over on Day One 
By the time [he (PRP)| Mr. Milken (NNP)] is out of jail , [it (PRP)| the time (NN)] is all over 
Steven Rosenfeld , an attorney for Mr. Milken , says there are no plans whatsoever for [his (PRP$)| Steven Rosenfeld (NNP)] client to seek bankruptcy-court protection 
The partner in the New York law firm of Paul , Weiss , Rifkind Wharton & Garrison says there is nothing particularly remarkable about the allegations in the lawsuits 
There is a word processor somewhere that spews out the same ... allegations , Mr. Rosenfeld says 
[I (PRP)| Steven Rosenfeld , an attorney for Mr. Milken (NNP)] view that as a plaintiff tactic 
As his partner Arthur Liman said the day before , Mr. Rosenfeld said the Milken camp believes the $ 400 million Mr. Milken is required to provide the SEC for civil restitution will more than cover any legitimate claims 
Still , the Milken team faces a morass of suits 
One of the most sweeping , filed last month in Los Angeles by shareholders of Unocal Corp. , accuses Mr. Milken , Drexel and many major takeover artists of the 1980s of a massive conspiracy that defrauded shareholders in takeover targets 
Mr. Greenfield's firm filed the suit along with plaintiff lawyer William S. Lerach of the shareholder law firm of Milberg Weiss Bershad Specthrie and Lerach 
[It (PRP)| Mr. Greenfield's firm (NN)] alleges a back-scratching arrangement by which Mr. Milken teamed up with high-profile corporate raiders to manipulate stock prices in huge acquisitions 
The suit , which seeks $ 2.3 billion in trebled damages , claims that more than 70 defendants violated the RICO law 
Under the alleged arrangement , Mr. Milken shared secret information with market operatives and backed the takeover attempts of such raiders as Carl Icahn , Ronald Perelman , T. Boone Pickens and others 
According to the allegations , a raider would typically tell Mr. Milken [he (PRP)| a raider (NN)] wanted to take over a particular company , and Mr. Milken would then issue junk bonds for the raider's companies and arrange for other raiders to buy the bonds 
The raiders felt obligated to buy the bonds because [they (PRP)| other raiders (NNS)] wanted Mr. Milken to fund [their (PRP$)| other raiders (NNS)] future takeover attempts , the suit says 
Meanwhile , at Mr. Milken's direction , arbitragers would purchase big blocks of stock in the target company with guarantees against loss provided by Mr. Milken , the suit claims 
While the Unocal suit claims enormous damages to shareholders , a suit filed by Mr. Greenfield's firm in February may be even broader 
The firm sued on behalf of at least 10,000 class members who purchased high-yield , high-risk bonds underwritten by and sold through Drexel 
[They (PRP)| at least 10,000 class members (NNS)] charged that the junk bond market was rigged , that prices were artificially determined and that without Mr. Milken to act as puppeteer , the market fell apart 
Action in this case is stalled for procedural reasons 
Also pending are a multitude of civil cases lodged in the past three years against Mr. Boesky , Drexel , Mr. Milken and others that accuse the defendants of insider trading , stock manipulation and other securities law violations 
Many of these cases are pending in federal court in New York , where pretrial fact-finding has been slowed because of the unavailability of Mr. Boesky , Mr. Milken and others to testify at depositions 
Thus far , federal prosecutors have gotten the judge to deny the plaintiffslawyers access to these witnesses while criminal investigations are being pursued 
But at some point , such a partial stay will presumably be lifted 
Finally , a sprinkling of cases across the country target Mr. Milken among many other defendants in cases alleging that savings and loans associations and other companies suffered losses because they purchased large portfolios of Drexel's junk bonds as part of back-scratching arrangements with Mr. Milken 
The strength of the plaintiffsvarious charges are difficult to gauge 
Mr. Greenfield likens [them (PRP)| the plaintiffs(NNS)] to the asbestos cases that led to the Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court filing of Manville Corp. , the giant asbestos manufacturer 
[He (PRP)| Richard Greenfield (NNP)] says [he (PRP)| Richard Greenfield (NNP)] believes that once one case breaks through to trial , Mr. Milken will have no choice but to start settling the rest of the cases 
But a spokesman for Mr. Pickens's Mesa Petroleum Co. , a defendant in the Unocal case , calls the allegations silly stuff 
[They (PRP)| the plaintiffs(NNS)] have taken any name that is appeared next to Boesky's or -LCB- Boyd -RCB- Jefferies's ... 
[They (PRP)| the plaintiffs(NNS)] are throwing names in the soup and alleging a scheme that is pure nonsense 
Mr. Jefferies , a former brokerage firm chief in Los Angles pleaded guilty to two felony counts of breaking securities laws in April 1987 
Says attorney James Conroy , commenting on behalf of Revlon Group Inc. 
Chairman Mr. Perelman and his MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings Inc. , The suit casts a net very broadly and names a lot of people in the process 
[We (PRP)| Chairman Mr. Perelman and his MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings Inc. , The suit (NNP)] do not belong there because there is no basis in fact for the allegations 
A civil case is always easier to prove than a criminal case because the civil plaintiff does not have to prove [his (PRP$)| the civil plaintiff (NN)] charges beyond a reasonable doubt 
Instead [he (PRP)| the civil plaintiff (NN)] must show only that the accusations are more likely than not to be correct 
Nonetheless , the plaintiff's lawyers agree that winning a trial against Mr. Milken would not be easy 
[It (PRP)| a trial (NN)] ca not be proven by a handful of witnesses and a handful of documents , says Mr. Greenfield 
Instead , the lawyers must attempt to show juries patterns of trades in which prices appear to be rigged and raise the issue of how the securities were priced 
The defendants , says R. Bruce McNew , a partner in Mr. Greenfield's firm , have to have an innocent explanation for what they have done 
In the process of proving [your (PRP$)| Richard Greenfield (NNP)] case , [you (PRP)| Richard Greenfield (NNP)] then take apart [their (PRP$)| many other defendants in cases alleging that savings and loans associations and other companies suffered losses because they (NNS)] explanation 
Alan Bromberg , a law professor at Southern Methodist University , says showing a chain of bond purchases does not necessarily prove that Mr. Milken was in control of the sellers and buyers , but [it (PRP)| Southern Methodist University (NNP)] does permit that inference 
The outcome of the case will depend on whether the jury believes there was a conspiracy or the sellers and purchasers of bonds made independent judgments 
Mr. Bromberg and others assert that Mr. Liman , Mr. Milken's principal lawyer , negotiated to make the plea agreement narrow enough so that little of what Mr. Milken admitted to can be used against [him (PRP)| Mr. Milken (NNP)] in the civil suits 
[I (PRP)| Alan Bromberg (NNP)] suspect [they (PRP)| others (NNS)] fought hard on that , and my guess is [they (PRP)| others (NNS)] were pretty successful at [it (PRP)| my guess (NN)] , Mr. Bromberg says 
However , a little-noticed provision in the plea agreement could prove to be invaluable to civil plaintiffs 
Prosecutors extracted a promise from Mr. Milken that [he (PRP)| Mr. Milken (NNP)] would not attempt to block [them (PRP)| federal prosecutors (NNS)] from including in [their (PRP$)| federal prosecutors (NNS)] sentencing memo many additional charges of wrongdoing to which he did not plead guilty 
Recently Robert Freeman , former Goldman , Sachs & Co. head of arbitrage , successfully blocked inclusion of such broader allegations in the government's sentencing memo 
Thus , the government's full case against Mr. Freeman , who had pleaded guilty to just one insider trading charge , was kept from public view 
In the Milken case , however , prosecutors are expected to outline a broad scheme of alleged wrongdoing , involving a wide range of companies and securities 
Those charges could be exceedingly helpful to plainitffs lawyers building civil cases against [him (PRP)| Mr. Milken (NNP)] 
Realistically , [it (PRP)| the Milken case (NN)] is highly unlikely that the civil cases against Mr. Milken will ever go to trial 
Most shareholder cases are settled , and Mr. Greenfield says [he (PRP)| Richard Greenfield (NNP)] has had only two jury trials in the past six years , while handling scores of suits 
One reason for this is that plaintiffslawyers typically do not charge hourly rates 
Instead they charge their clients for a percentage of the settlement or jury award , generally 20 % to 30 % 
Therefore , [it (PRP)| One reason for this (NN)] is often to their benefit to dispose of cases as quickly as possible 
But settlements work only if both sides believe they are making a fair compromise , considering what the damages might be if the case went to trial 
And , in the Milken litigation , settling so many high-stakes cases could be a long and tricky process in [itself (PRP)| the Milken litigation (NN)]
