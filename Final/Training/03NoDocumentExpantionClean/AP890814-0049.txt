A total lunar eclipse visible from five continents occurs after sunset Wednesday when the full moon orbits into the shadow of the Earth and slowly turns from a bright silver into a copper or orange disk 
More than a billion people will have a chance to watch as the moon appears to be slowly nibbled away, changing from the normal bright reflected light of a full moon into the colorful glow of eclipse 
The celestial show starts at 8:23 p.m. EDT over the United States and will end about 5 -LCB- hours later 
The eastern United States will get the best viewing and Alaska will miss the eclipse altogether 
Visible eclipse phases will vary for the central and western parts of the country because of the difference in sunset and moonrise 
In Los Angeles, for instance, the eclipse will have started before the sun has set or the moon has risen 
By the time the sky has darkened completely in California, the moon will already be in the deepest part of its eclipse 
For Seattle, the moon will still be below the horizon at mid-eclipse, but will rise during the totality phase 
Clouds, of course, could ruin the viewing at any location 
With clear skies, though, some phase of the celestial spectacle should be visible to observers in North and South America, western Europe and Africa, and the Antarctic 
Sailors at sea in the Atlantic and in the eastern Pacific Ocean also will be able to see part of the eclipse, weather permitting 
A lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes through the shadow created by the Earth blocking the sun's light 
The moon, in its orbit of the Earth, usually passes above or below this shadowline, but every few years it follows a path that puts it completely in shade for a time 
When the whole moon passes through the shadow, it is called a total eclipse 
The last total lunar eclipse visible over most of North America occurred in December 1982, and the next one is not until December 1992 
Astronomers are forecasting that Wednesday's eclipse may be a bright one 
The moon can appear during an eclipse to be a bright coppery red if there is clear, clean air between the lunar surface and the observer on Earth 
If smoke or dust obscure the view, the moon will diminish to an orange color or perhaps even fade from view altogether 
Volcanic eruptions historically have dimmed eclipse viewing by dumping tons of dust into the atmosphere 
But astronomers say enough time has passed since the last major volcanic eruption that most dust has settled 
The eclipse starts when the moon enters what is called the penumbra 
This outer fringe of the Earth's shadow will show up on the moon as a grayish shading 
After about half an hour, the moon will edge into the umbra, the dark, central part of the shadow 
Total eclipse, when all of the moon is covered by the umbra, will begin at about 10:20 p.m. EDT and last for one hour, 36 minutes 
When the moon leaves the umbra, the events will occur in reverse order 
The eclipse ends about 1:53 a.m. EDT when the moon edges out of the shadow altogether 
While a lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth blocks sunlight from the moon, a solar eclipse is caused when the moon blocks sunlight from the Earth 
To experts, a solar eclipse is more interesting because it permits unique measurements of the sun 
 Solar eclipses attract a lot of scientific attention,  said John Bangert, a U.S. Naval Observatory astronomer in Washington 
 A lunar eclipse is just a good show . 
Here is when the various phases of the eclipse will occur 
All times are Eastern daylight
