Republican George Bush claims Clinton has governed poorly in Arkansas.
This article is an assessment of Clinton's governorship.

Arkansas still ranks number 47 in income in the United States.  Per
capita income has not changed.

His first term was a failure.  He stepped on too many toes, charged in
"like a knight on a white horse," wanting to change everything.  His
term out of office matured him.

Real progress came in the areas of education and economic development,
with some inroads into welfare reform.

Mr. Clinton failed to make improvements in the areas of the
environment, civil rights or health care.
