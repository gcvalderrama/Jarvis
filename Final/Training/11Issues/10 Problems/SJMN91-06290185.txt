Despite lurid charges of sexual harassment, Clarence Thomas has won
confirmation by a 52-48 vote, the closest for a Supreme Court Justice
in more than a century. The Senate vote followed a 7-7 deadlock in the
Judiciary Committee where Thomas vehemently denied charges by Law
Professor Anita Hill. Eleven Democrats joined 41 Republicans to
produce the slim majority. President Bush congratulated Thomas and
called him "a wonderful inspiration," but the Women's Legal Defense
Fund said,"...the Senate sacrificed the integrity of the Supreme
Court... to the Bush-Reagan agenda." As the youngest Supreme Court
Justice, Thomas is expected to remain on the court for decades.
