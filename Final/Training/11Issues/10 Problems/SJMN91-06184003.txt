On Monday President Bush nominated Clarence Thomas, a conservative
black Republican, to replace black liberal Justice Thurgood Marshall
on the Supreme Court.  Conservatives quickly embraced the nomination
while liberals responded either with caution or hostility. Aside from
his strong opposition to affirmative action, Thomas's views on other
major issues before the court are unknown. Although Thomas attended
Roman Catholic schools and studied for the priesthood and the Catholic
Church vigorously opposes abortion, Thomas has apparently never taken
a public stand on abortion or the constitutional right to privacy. If
Thomas remains silent on these issues his nomination is likely to be
confirmed.
