Charles Keating is not shy. When queried if his financial support of
politicians is intended to influence them in favor of his cause,
replied: "I want to say in the most forceful way I can, I certainly
hope so."

Neither is Keating shy about involving family members, friends and
associates in campaign contributions to federal and state politicians.

Never before, say regulators, had a single savings and loan operator
had enough political pull to get five U. S. senators working on his
behalf.

There is yet another side to Keating. In 1957, he was a congressional
lobbyist in the war against pornography.
