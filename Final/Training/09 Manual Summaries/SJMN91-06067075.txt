Rodney King was released from jail after officers failed to prove he
had resisted arrest after a high speed chase.

Police Chief Darryl Gates called the beating an "aberration" and the
department issued no statements; the LAPD, FBI and California Highway
Patrol are investigating.

The chase began when California Highway Patrol pursued King at high
speed, called for assistance, then pulled him over.  When King left
the highway, the Highway patrolmen were ordered off the investigation,
but observed King being shot by a stun gun, beaten with clubs and
stomped on the head.

Many people in Los Angeles feel that non-anglos are the targets of
police.
