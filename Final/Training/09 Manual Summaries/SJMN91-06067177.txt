Los Angeles police wanted prosecutors to charge King with battery on
an officer and resisting arrest, according to his lawyer, Mr. Rentzer,
but the DA refused.  He sent the case back to police for further
investigation.  He also said officers failed to interview available
witnesses, including King's passengers.

The ten officers involved were taken off patrol.
	
King stated he was struck at least forty times as he begged them to
stop, and denied the high speeds he was accused of in the chase.

Two local residents witnessed the incident and one of them videotaped
it, then released the tape to national media.
