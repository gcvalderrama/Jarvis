Judge Bork specializes in antitrust law.  In testimony before the
Senate Judiciary Committee, legal experts differed sharply over what
impact Bork's free-market approach to antitrust law would have on
competition and consumers.  Some say his antitrust views are too
conservative.  Others praise his approach as "designed to promote
consumer welfare."

President Reagan believes special interest groups have conducted a
deliberate campaign of disinformation and distortion about Bork, aimed
to sway moderate Republicans who along with southern Democrats are
needed to defeat Bork's nomination. White House officials also believe
that Bork's record as a crime fighter hasn't received sufficient
attention during the hearings.
