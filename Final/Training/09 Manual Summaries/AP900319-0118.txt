Robert H. Bork stood before the nation's highest court as a lawyer,
making him the first defeated Supreme Court nominee ever to argue
before its justices.  There was no mention of his 1987 nomination
fight as Bork engaged in debate with the justices and opposing lawyers
over the complexities of international banking, federal law and
related matters.  They questioned him vigorously, as did Justice
Anthony M. Kennedy, who occupies the seat that eluded Bork.  Bork is
only the sixth man this century to be denied a Supreme Court seat by
the Senate and the twenty-sixth in its history.
