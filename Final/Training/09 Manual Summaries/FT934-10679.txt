Over 28,500 people died from eruptions in the 1980s, most in
Colombia's 1986 Nevado del Ruiz eruption, prompting the US Geological
Survey to improve forecasting. They predicted the eruptions of
Alaska's Redoubt Volcano in 1989 and the Philippines' Pinatubo in
1991. In Hawaii, resorts ask the USGS for best viewing times for
Kilauea, which has erupted continuously since 1983 and become a
tourist attraction. After Washington's Mount St. Helens wiped out
timberland, Weyerhaueuser consulted experts on where to replant. But
after California's Long Valley and Guadeloupe's tourist economies
suffered from false alarms, Long Valley residents refuse to heed land
use warnings.
