Mount Pinatubo continues to be wracked by increasingly violent
eruptions as Typhoon YUNYA slammed into the eastern coast of Luzon,
Philippine Islands. The two forces of nature threaten to engulf cities
and towns in their path.

Temperatures of rivers were rising due to hot ash. Debris was clogging
everything including generators, thus disrupting power supplies.

Pinatubo began erupting violently on Friday and these explosions are
seen as a single eruption.  The eruption is occurring at the same time
as U.S.- Philippine discussions on a military bases treaty.  Pinatubo
could remain active for years, possibly rendering Clark
inoperable.
