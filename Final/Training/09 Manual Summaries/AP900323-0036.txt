On Thursday, an Alaskan jury acquitted former Exxon Valdez captain,
Joseph Hazelwood, of all but a minor pollution charge.  Maximum
penalty could be 90 days in jail and a $1,000 fine.  He was found not
guilty of felony mischief, operating a vessel while under the
influence of alcohol, and reckless endangerment.  Applause greeted the
verdict.  Jurors were swayed by the defense argument that the incident
was an accident, not a crime.  The defense had argued that he drank
between the incident and the sobriety test, and that the Coast Guard
did not do its job.  Exxon Corp still faces federal criminal charges
and Hazelwood is named in 150 civil lawsuits.
