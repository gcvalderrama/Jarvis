Biosphere II, a domed glass and steel Garden of Eden in the foothills
of Arizona's Santa Catalina range, will begin an experiment on
Thursday in a biological maze where plants will recycle human wastes
and turn them into the sustenance of life--air, food, and water.  At
the least, it is intended to help improve life on Earth.  There is a
great deal of skepticism about the credibility and usefulness of the
experiment.  Biosphere officials counter by pointing to 50 design
patents in the works.  They also claim it is a business-- Arizona's
second largest tourist attraction after the Grand Canyon.
