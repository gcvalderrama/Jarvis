A coalition of California law enforcement officials concerned about
proliferation of semiautomatic firearms is drafting legislation to
outlaw the manufacture and sale of such guns.

Pitted against this effort is the National Rifle Association and the
Gun Owners of California who oppose any controls.

The NRA contends that the legislation will not deter criminals from
acquiring the weapons, but will hurt law-abiding citizens.  They favor
harsher treatment of criminals: no plea bargaining, no parole.
Proposed legislation would exempt "good guns," those used by hunters,
target shooters and collectors.  The difficulty, they feel, is in
distinguishing the two types since all operate on the same principle.
