Boris Yeltsin, the newly elected president of the Russian republic,
sat down with 130 legislators today to negotiate the makeup of a
coalition government for the largest Soviet republic.  Legislators
said that he opened the meeting in a businesslike fashion and set only
one limit, asking that one of his deputies be a woman.
Representatives of each political faction and each ethnic region in
the Russian Federation were present.  Yeltsin asked for two to three
nominations for each ministerial post in the Russian government.  He
said the candidates would be presented to the full Russian Congress
for confirmation starting Thursday.
