A partial solar eclipse was visible across western North America on
Tuesday morning.  While the moon eclipsed 37 percent of the sun,
mountains on the edge of the moon could be seen silhouetted against
the sun.  Gas jets on the sun's surface and a giant group of sunspots
were also visible.  The eclipse was visible to some extent west of a
diagonal line stretching roughly from Mazatlan, Mexico, northeast to
Dallas and Chicago.  Scientists warned against staring at the sun
directly or through inadequate filters.  After an eclipse in 1970, 245
eye injuries were reported in the U.S., but warnings about the danger
reduced the number to three during a 1984 partial eclipse.
