The election of Boris Yeltsin as president of the Russian republic is
a stunning personal defeat for Mikhail Gorbachev.  Yeltsin is certain
to strike a triple blow against Gorbachev's political line by (1)
challenging the Soviet government's referendum on economic austerity;
(2) opposing the policy of imperial centralism; and (3) challenging
the legitimacy of Gorbachev's presidency, perhaps to the point of
forcing a new Union- wide election.

On the political front, Yeltsin will favor a multi-party system and
oppose Lenin's principle of "democratic centralism."  He favors
dismantling the Communist Party, as well as "depoliticization" of the
Army, the Interior Ministry, and the KGB.
