The $630 million Mirage fantasy-island hotel and casino will open in
November with a 60-foot mountain volcano that will erupt spewing smoke
and flames every five minutes.  It is the most stunning example of Las
Vegas's concerted effort to transform itself into a world famous
vacation resort for families as well as gamblers.  One resort will
hold jousting tournaments while another has plans for an on-site
amusement park.  Caesars Palace is building a $100 million shopping
complex comparable with Rodeo Drive.

Ferocious competition may drive some properties into bankruptcy or new
ownership.  Another concern is whether the new mega-resorts will be
able to make a profit.
