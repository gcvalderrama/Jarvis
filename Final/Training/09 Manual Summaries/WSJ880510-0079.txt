Congress will soon consider a boost in the minimum wage.  An impetus
has been the recent increases by several states in their minimum
wages.  No state now has a minimum as high as the proposed national
standard of $5.05.  States with high minimum wage typically have low
levels of unemployment and high cost of living.  Some states have wage
minimums much lower than the present national standard.  A Chamber of
Commerce spokesman says that states are in a better position to set
minimum standards since the amount paid to a worker is determined by
local supply and demand.
