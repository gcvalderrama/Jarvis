Fifteen thousand military personnel at Clark Air Base, Philippine
Islands, began to evacuate today due to the eruption of Mount
Pinatubo.  This order came in the wake of a Philippine government
order for an evacuation of 11,000 people from 20 villages near the
volcano. Following two moderate eruptions, a larger explosion is
expected to follow. One Philippine official said that the volcano is
spewing gas up to 1800 degrees, thick ash, boulders and rocks.

Mt. Pinatubo is located in the "Ring of Fire" that encircles the
Pacific Ocean.  It is its first eruption in 600 years.
