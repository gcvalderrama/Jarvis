When the 25 cent an hour minimum wage became law 50 years earlier,
industries warned of economic mayhem.  Alarms are likely to be again
sounded when Senator Kennedy and Congressman Hawkins introduce
legislation to increase today's minimum wage from $3.35 to about $4.65
an hour.  Final shape of the bill is not set and may prompt a veto
from the president who once said that a minimum wage caused more
unemployment and misery than anything since the Great Depression.  The
AFL-CIO argues that an increase is long overdue since the minimum wage
has not kept pace with rising living standards.
