Two Coast Guard technicians testified on Monday that they did not warn
the Exxon Valdez that it had disappeared from radar until the tanker
ran aground on March 24, while detouring around ice in the treacherous
Prince William Sound.  Another loaded tanker had taken a similar
detour around ice four hours earlier without any problems.  The
technicians also admitted that the radar was less than reliable.
Defense lawyers are emphasizing this testimony in the trial of the
Valdez's captain.  The captain faces up to 7 years and 3 months in
jail and a $61,000 fine.
