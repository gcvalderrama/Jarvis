An engine fire broke out early today on a cruise ship carrying more
than 700 people in the Gulf of Mexico, but the blaze appeared to have
been brought under control, according to officials.

The Scandinavian Star was about 35 miles off Isla Mujares, a Mexican
island north of the tourist resort Cancun in the Yucatan Peninsula.

Petty Officer Brian Lincoln of the U.S. Coast Guard's Miami office
said no injuries were reported.  "All we know is that the ship's
captain "is completely out of fire-fighting equipment and has
requested additional equipment such as foam, water and CO2," said
Lincoln.
