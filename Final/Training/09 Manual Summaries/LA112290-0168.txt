Michael Milken is a very smart, very driven and very flawed human
being. He started dealing in junk bonds and took a good idea too
far. His competitive juices and obsession with control led him to do
sleazy things. When the market was small no one cared what he was
doing, but when it was big, that changed. The SEC went after Milken
only when a trail of stool pigeons fingered Ivan F.  Boesky, who
fingered Milken. Milken was brilliant, but he had no sense of how
others perceived him. He didn't blame himself for his problems, but
blamed the media. Now he has lost everything.
