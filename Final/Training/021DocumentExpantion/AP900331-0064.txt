Here are key provisions of the legislation Congress passed last year to increase the minimum wage to $ 4.25 an hour and establish a subminimum training wage for certain teen-age workers 
The measure takes effect Sunday 
The minimum wage , $ 3.35 an hour since January 1981 , increases to $ 3.80 an hour on Sunday and to $ 4.25 an hour on April 1 , 1991 
An estimated 4 million Americans work for the minimum wage 
Workers ages 16 to 19 may be paid a subminimum training wage for their first three months in the work force and for an additional 90 days if the employer has a formal training program 
The training wage will be $ 3.35 an hour when the minimum wage rises to $ 3.80 an hour and $ 3.62 an hour when the minimum wage reaches $ 4.25 next April 
Migrant seasonal farmworkers are exempt from the subminimum and the entire subminimum provision expires in April 1993 
After the increase , full-time minimum wage workers would still find full-time minimum wage workers $ 516 a year short of what the increase takes to support one adult and one child at the poverty level , according to government figures 
Minimum wage workers would be $ 4,796 below the basic needs level for a family of four 
The wage employers are required to pay workers who receive tips will increase from 40 percent of the minimum wage to 45 percent of the minimum wage on April 1 
The law requires that tips plus wages must equal the minimum hourly wage 
The percentage goes to 50 percent a year from now 
The level at which small businesses are exempt from the federal minimum wage increases from $ 362,500 in gross annual sales to $ 500,000 
Hundreds of special exemptions exist , such as for some farm workers , including tobacco leaf harvesters , casual babysitters , newspaper delivery workers , amusement park employees , wreath makers , employees at small radio stations in cities with fewer than 25,000 residents and mollusk and crustacean harvesters
