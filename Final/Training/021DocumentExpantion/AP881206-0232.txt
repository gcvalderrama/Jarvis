The explosion occurred as police were awakening area residents and telling police to evacuate 
Sickmeier was treated for seven months at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston for third-degree burns that covered most of his body 
Jerry Sickmeier also suffered burns in Jerry Sickmeier lungs and spent more than two months on a respirator
