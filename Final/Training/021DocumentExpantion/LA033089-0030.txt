Michael Milken , the Drexel Burnham Lambert junk bond wizard in Beverly Hills who revolutionized U.S. corporate finance and raised funds for dozens of corporate raids , was indicted Wednesday on federal racketeering , insider trading and other securities fraud counts 
The long-expected indictment also named Milken's brother , Lowell Milken , and a former Drexel trader , Bruce L. Newberg 
If convicted on the racketeering charges , the three could face an astronomical amount in financial penalties : The indictment asks that Milken 's brother , Lowell Milken , and a former Drexel trader , Bruce L. Newberg forfeit a total of $ 1.85 billion , representing Milken 's brother , Lowell Milken , and a former Drexel trader , Bruce L. Newberg salaries , other compensation and Milken 's brother , Lowell Milken , and a former Drexel trader , Bruce L. Newberg share of Drexel profits , all earned in what the government charges was a continuing criminal enterprise operated at the New York-based investment banking firm 
Fines Could Be Doubled In addition , the federal racketeering law , known as the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act , or RICO , at least theoretically could subject RICO to twice that amount in fines 
This means each defendant could face up to $ 3.7 billion in fines on the two RICO charges 
They also face additional fines on the other counts totaling in the millions of dollars 
Michael Milken faces a maximum jail sentence of about 300 years , with lesser amounts for the other two defendants 
The indictment apparently marks the end of Milken's 20-year career at the firm that Michael Milken junk bond operation transformed from a second-rank investment bank to one of the powerhouses on Wall Street 
Junk bonds are high-risk , high-yield debt securities 
Immediately after the 98-count indictment was returned by a federal grand jury , Drexel said that Milken , 42 , and his brother , 40 , had requested and been granted leaves of absence 
John Kissick , formerly head of the firm's corporate finance department in Beverly Hills , has been expected to take Michael Milken's place 
The criminal charges result from the biggest criminal securities fraud investigation ever undertaken by the government 
The inquiry has been under way for over two years 
Benito Romano , the U.S. attorney in Manhattan , said this specific investigation is continuing and did not rule out the possibility that additional individuals may be charged soon 
The charges filed Wednesday mean that Newberg is now facing two separate racketeering indictments 
Bruce L. Newberg is also named as a defendant in an indictment returned last July relating to Princeton/Newport Partners , a small investment firm that did business with Drexel 
The charges against Bruce L. Newberg appear to cover the same general chain of events 
Lowell Milken , a lawyer , gave up a promising legal career in the 1970s to help Michael Milken brother run Drexel's Beverly Hills office 
The indictment charges that Lowell was Lowell brother's principal adviser in the conduct of the conspiracy 
Sources at the firm said the indictment of Michael Milken probably would clear the way for Drexel to swiftly settle civil charges filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission 
Milken's continued presence at the firm was a major sticking point in the talks 
Settlement with the SEC , in turn , would remove the last obstacle to Drexel's carrying out Drexel pledge to plead guilty to six criminal counts and pay $ 650 million in financial penalties 
The firm had entered into that agreement in December , in part to avoid more serious racketeering charges and a possible huge forfeiture of assets 
The 110-page indictment returned Wednesday appears to closely follow the civil charges contained in an SEC lawsuit filed in September against Drexel and the Milkens 
Wednesday contains only a few charges that were not in the SEC's complaint and leaves out a number that were 
The indictment accuses Michael Milken of a prolonged pattern of insider trading , stock market manipulation and defrauding clients 
a prolonged pattern of insider trading , stock market manipulation and defrauding clients claims that Michael Milken of a prolonged pattern of insider trading , stock market manipulation and defrauding clients sought to enrich Michael Milken of a prolonged pattern of insider trading , stock market manipulation and defrauding clients through self-dealing at the same time that Michael Milken of a prolonged pattern of insider trading , stock market manipulation and defrauding clients was acting on behalf of Drexel's customers 
Areas of Wrongdoing The indictment charges three broad areas of wrongdoing 
One involves transactions with former stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky , who pleaded guilty to a single criminal charge and gave prosecutors the information that touched off the Drexel investigation 
The indictment charges that Milken used Boesky's firm to hide illegal stock trading 
The second broad area involves transactions with Princeton/Newport Partners , in which Drexel and Milken allegedly helped Princeton/Newport carry out tax fraud through sham securities trades with Drexel 
Among other charges , the indictment alleges that Drexel used Princeton/Newport to illegally manipulate the price of COMB Co. securities in 1985 
The third general area involves alleged straight insider trading in the securities of Lorimar Inc. and Viacom Inc. by Michael Milken 
Although the government could immediately ask a federal judge to freeze the three defendantspersonal assets , Romano , the U.S. attorney in Manhattan , said a federal judge probably will not do that 
a federal judge said a federal judge office has been negotiating with the defendantslawyers and added that a federal judge expects a bond to be posted by the three men , covering at least a part of the amount the defendants ' lawyers may be required to forfeit to the government 
Expects Assurances Romano said a federal judge expects to receive written assurances that assets covering the rest will not be dissipated before a trial is held 
When asked about the huge amounts , among the largest that individuals have been asked to forfeit in a RICO case , Romano said the numbers represented the extraordinary levels of compensation and stock ownership in the (illegal )Drexel enterprise paid to Michael Milken and the others 
The indictment notes that Milken received $ 1.1 billion in direct compensation from Drexel from 1984 through 1987 , as well as millions in other forms of compensation , and that Michael Milken is Drexel's largest individual stockholder , owning about 6 % of the firm 
According to the indictment , Milken's pay was $ 123.8 million in 1984 and $ 135 million in 1985 , then more than doubled in 1986 to $ 294.8 million 
In 1987 , Michael Milken was paid $ 550 million 
The indictment says that , during those years , Milken's personal compensation amounted to between 28 % and 44 % of the junk bond department's gross revenues 
Lowell Milken allegedly received $ 102 million in direct compensation during the same period 
Drexel's tentative settlement of the six criminal charges pending against the firm calls for Drexel 's tentative settlement of the six criminal charges to withhold nearly all of Michael Milken's compensation from 1988 , as well as about $ 13 million owed to Lowell Milken 
But the brothers are challenging that in court as a violation of their constitutional rights , and a violation of their constitutional rights will be up to a federal judge to decide 
The $ 1.85-billion total that the three are being asked to forfeit was based in part on calculations of how much each of them had received from Drexel 
But Romano said that , under the law , each of them could be held jointly and separately liable for the full amount 
Michael Milken has been reported to have a personal net worth of nearly $ 1 billion 
Arthur L. Liman , one of Milken's main defense lawyers , said in a written statement that Milken will plead not guilty with confidence that in a fair trial Michael Milken will be acquitted 
Liman said : The charges against Mr. Milken are essentially a repetition of the accusations made by Ivan Boesky and others as Ivan Boesky and others bargained for leniency or immunity from prosecution 
Both Milkens strongly denied the charges against Ivan Boesky and others 
Michael Milken said in a written press release : Michael Milken am confident that in the end Michael Milken will be vindicated 
Lowell Milken said that the proof will show that Michael Milken had virtually no contacts with Ivan Boesky , and that Michael Milken had little , if anything , to do with the events the prosecutors misrepresent in order to construct the prosecutors charges 
Michael Milken 's brother added that Michael Milken 's brother have been thrown into this indictment because of a fact in which Michael Milken 's brother take great pride -- Michael Milken 's brother am Michael Milken's brother 
Michael Armstrong , Lowell's lawyer , said in a brief interview that Michael Armstrong found little that was unexpected in the indictment 
It seems like little more than a rehash of what the SEC came out with six months ago , Michael Armstrong said 
In another statement , two lawyers representing Newberg accused the government of seeking to punish Newberg for refusing to become a prosecution witness by indicting a prosecution witness twice on racketeering charges 
The second RICO indictment of Mr. Newberg , containing essentially the same charges as those in the first indictment , is a total perversion of the RICO statute , the lawyers said 
Newberg could not be reached for comment 
Bruce L. Newberg left Drexel when it became apparent that Bruce L. Newberg was going to be charged in the Princeton/Newport case 
Romano said that none of the three would be arrested 
Instead , they will be allowed to present themselves for arraignment , probably one week from today 
The government requested that U.S. District Judge Kimba M. Wood be assigned to the case , because she is already presiding over the case in which Drexel is expected to plead guilty to six charges 
The indictment conspicuously leaves out a number of names of Drexel employees who reportedly have been under investigation 
Several of them had received target letters from prosecutors warning them that they faced indictment 
Defense lawyers said Defense lawyers believe that the government may file additional indictments , or file a new indictment , superseding the one handed up Wednesday , that would include more individuals as defendants
