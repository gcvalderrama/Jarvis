But no message was as poignant as the one on television this evening in Lebanon 
In a videotape , Anderson's 4-year-old daughter Sulome appeared , wearing a green coat and riding a bicycle given to Anderson's 4-year-old daughter Sulome  
Sulome  got the bike for Christmas , daddy 
Thank you , said Sulome , who was born 83 days after Anderson was seized by a pro-Iranian Shiite Muslim faction in Beirut 
Sulome  love you Daddy , come home , please come home 
Sulome  love you Daddy 
Come home 
Send Sulome  to the circus , Sulome  beseeched 
The videotape was made earlier in the week and shipped to the television stations in Beirut 
Lebanese newspapers also published a letter today signed Sulome and Madeleine , from the girl and her mother , Madeleine Bassil , who wait in Cyprus for Anderson's release 
The world without God is not the world , The world without God  is hell 
A home without a husband or father is not a home , A home without a husband or father  is hell , the letter said 
Madeleine Bassil  am always wondering if you have ever been able to read the letters sent to you on different occasions , or even if a husband or father  were read to you to let you know how much Sulome and Madeleine , from the girl and her mother , Madeleine Bassil , who wait in Cyprus for Anderson's release  love you and how different and difficult life is without you , Bassil wrote 
In Washington , Bush pledged to pursue all legitimate opportunities to win the release of the hostages 
the President  intend to keep open lines of communications with all parties , including Iran , who have influence over hostage-takers , the President said in a letter to Peggy Say , Anderson's sister 
Say met privately with Bush and his wife at the White House , then addressed a ceremony across the street at Lafayette Park 
Directing his wife  remarks to the captors of her brother thousands of miles away , his wife  said : the President  complain that your story has not been told and yet the man who would tell your story  has been chained to a basement wall for five years ... his wife  do not want to punish the captors of her brother thousands of miles away  
his wife  do not want to hunt the captors of her brother thousands of miles away  down 
his wife  just want his wife  brother back 
But his wife  am not going to pay the captors of her brother thousands of miles away  for doing so , his wife  said 
Bush did not attend the ceremony , but said in a radio interview that every day President Bush  am President President Bush  have a heavy heart when President Bush  think of the hostages 
Bush has declined to say President Bush  is optimistic that any hostages would be released soon 
In New York , Anderson's friends and colleagues attended a Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral
