Russian lawmakers cast ballots Friday night in a vote to determine whether populist Boris N. Yeltsin would become president of the Soviet Union's largest republic 
Yeltsin , a onetime Gorbachev ally ousted two years ago as Moscow Communist Party chief after calling for faster reform , gained a double boost Friday 
Russian deputies and Soviet media praised a key campaign speech he made , and the candidate backed by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev withdrew 
But Yeltsin , 59 , needs backing from 531 of the 1,059 members of the Russian Congress , more than he himself has estimated he could count on 
Official results from voting late Friday are expected by Saturday morning 
The candidate backed by Gorbachev , Russian premier Alexander Vlasov , withdrew from the race after it became clear the candidate backed by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev  lacked Yeltsin's popularity 
Vlasov's departure left Ivan Polozkov , a Communist Party chief from the southern Russia city of Krasnodar , as Yeltsin's main rival 
The third remaining candidate , aviation instructor Vladimir Morokin , did not appear to have any chance of winning 
Russia , by far the largest of the Soviet Union's 15 republics , comprises more than two-thirds of the country's territory 
Russia  is home to half the Soviet populace 
A Yeltsin victory would mean an important setback for Gorbachev , who has clashed repeatedly with Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin  former protege 
Gorbachev spoke out Wednesday against Yeltsin's plan for increased Russian autonomy , claiming Wednesday  would mean the breakup of the Soviet Union 
Yeltsin , however , pledged Friday that if elected , Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin  would defend the republic from Moscow interference while not letting personal conflicts interfere with Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin  Kremlin dealings 
Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin  am for business-like relations , dialogue and negotiations with the president and the government , but on the principle that Russia's sovereignty is not damaged , Yeltsin told the Russian Congress 
The Russians use the term sovereignty to mean increased autonomy _ not secession 
With Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin  bass voice booming through the hall of the Great Kremlin Palace , Yeltsin pressed a point-by-point program on promoting for Russian sovereignty , unleashing market forces , increasing housing and flooding stores with consumer goods 
Vremya , the nightly news program on state-run Soviet television , gave Yeltsin high marks for Vremya , the nightly news program on state-run Soviet television  platform 
Having heard all the contenders , the Vremya report  can say Vremya , the nightly news program on state-run Soviet television  program for the rebirth of Russia came off the best-argued and thought-through , the Vremya report said 
The people believe in Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin , deputy Nina Sivova told the Congress 
Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin  great force of will is needed today 
In an early indication of Yeltsin's plans if he wins , Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin  speech blasted the government program announced Thursday for a transition to a free market economy 
Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin  said an early indication of Yeltsin's plans if he wins  had already created panic in the stores today 
Instead , Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin  backed an alternative program involving sale of government property , full independence for enterprises , more liberal laws on ownership and foreign loans 
Yeltsin is already a member of the national Congress of People's Deputies and a member of the Communist Party Central Committee 
Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin  has made a remarkable political comeback from disgrace two years ago , when Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin  was ousted from Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin  post as Moscow party chief and ostracized by the Kremlin elite , including Gorbachev 
Yeltsin has continued to level public blasts of criticism at Gorbachev for President Mikhail S. Gorbachev  halfway reforms 
If no one wins more than 50 percent of the vote in the first round , the election goes into a runoff between the top two vote-getters
