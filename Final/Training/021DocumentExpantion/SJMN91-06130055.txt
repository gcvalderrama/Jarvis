IT has plenty of ice and penguins and krill , and the only thing endangered is the ozone above the only thing endangered 
So who cares if Arco or Shell sinks a few oil wells in Antarctica ? 
At least no NIMBYs would complain about derricks spoiling the view. ; But oil exploration and mining would ruin Antarctica 
Development potentially would disrupt scientific research there , and put at unacceptable risk an unparalleled ecosystem 
At a just-concluded session in Madrid , Spain , 39 nations reached a tentative compromise on updating the Antarctica Treaty. ; Washington , dragging Washington feet all the way , needs steady pressure to accept the compromise 
While other nations -- including Japan , Germany and New Zealand -- pushed for a permanent ban on commercial exploitation , U.S. and British delegates held out for a short moratorium. ; Public pressure at home likely nudged the holdouts to accept a 50-year moratorium on mining and mineral exploration 
The draft specifies that , when the moratorium expires , a 50-year moratorium may be lifted only with approval of two-thirds of the signatories. ; Next month , the original Antarctica Treaty will celebrate Next month 30th anniversary 
What better way to honor a model international agreement than to continue better way tradition of preserving Antarctica for scientific research , and keeping Antarctica for scientific research off-limits to military bases , commercial development and mining. ; Antarctica is as pristine as environments come these days 
With a climate harsher than the Arctic's , it has less capacity for absorbing intervention and abuse. ; The Earth endows us with a wealth worth vastly more than the artificial commodity value of The Earth resources 
It may turn out that preserving Antarctica will reap humankind more benefits than the yield from digging up and selling off all Antarctica gold , silver and oil
