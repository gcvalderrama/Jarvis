In choosing federal Judge Robert Bork for the Supreme Court , President Reagan has tapped a leading architect of conservative legal theory -- and has ensured a tough confirmation battle in the Senate 
The selection of the 60-year-old Judge Bork to replace retiring Justice Lewis Powell gives the president the 60-year-old Judge Bork third Supreme Court appointment and by far the 60-year-old Judge Bork greatest opportunity to alter the court's direction

From the outset , Judge Bork was the clear front-runner to fill the vacancy , being favored by Attorney General Edwin Meese and his aides
