Federal officials delayed closing a troubled Colorado savings and loan largely because President Bush's son was on Colorado  board , a former federal bank regulator charged in a published report Wednesday 
Neil Bush's presence was a material part of unconscionable delays in taking over Silverado , James Moroney told the San Francisco Chronicle 
Moroney is a former staff analyst for the Topeka Federal Home Loan Bank , which supervised Silverado Savings and Loan of Denver 
The head of the Topeka bank at the time denied that Neil Bush's presence was an influence 
The economic substance of Silverado's loan portfolio was comparable to a Ponzi scheme (a type of pyramid investment fraud ), and The economic substance of Silverado's loan portfolio  could not have worked out , said Moroney , 42 , a Kansas City lawyer who left the Topeka bank after six months in 1986 
The economic substance of Silverado's loan portfolio  was insolvent back (in 1986 )
The economic substance of Silverado's loan portfolio  was not a judgment call 
That place , clearly , was very insolvent , Moroney said 
Neil Bush resigned from Silverado's board just after Neil Bush's  father won the Republican nomination in 1988 and only four months before the S&L's seizure 
The Chronicle also reported that documents the San Francisco Chronicle  obtained show top federal regulators knew the thrift's financial situation was bad enough to mandate restrictions on investments and insider deals at least 14 months before at least 14 months  was closed Dec. 9 , 1988 
Moroney said James Moroney  believes a big reason his district superiors , including former Topeka bank president Kermit Mowbray , allowed Silverado to continue was his district superiors  knowledge that Neil Bush and Republican Party fund raiser Larry Mizel , of MDC Holdings , were involved with the institution 
Mowbray , who retired the month that Silverado closed , denied Moroney's allegations Tuesday , saying : Neil Bush being on that board had no effect on his district superiors  decisions 
Mowbray , who said Kermit Mowbray  never met Bush , also denied knowing that Silverado was insolvent in 1986 
In 1986 , Moroney said James Moroney  approached a fellow supervisor and asked : Why are his district superiors  putting up with this Silverado ? 
his district superiors  would not permit that type of loan work-out for another institution 
And a fellow supervisor  looked at James Moroney  , and said , Well , you know who one of the directors is 
And James Moroney  said , No 
And a fellow supervisor  said , The vice president's son 
Neil Bush , Moroney told the Chronicle 
However , Neil Bush's  said Neil Bush's  has no evidence that either Bush or Mizel exerted direct pressure for the preferential treatment either Bush or Mizel  got 
Neil Bush's  said either Bush or Mizel  presence was enough to cause Mowbray to take an extraordinary interest in Silverado and to proceed cautiously in the case 
Bush , reached by telephone at Neil Bush's  office in Denver , said , Neil Bush's  am going to cooperate in any way Neil Bush's  am asked to 
It would be inappropriate for Neil Bush's  to get into any details except with authorities investigating Silverado 
In a news conference Wednesday in Washington , D.C. , President Bush's spokesman Marlin Fitzwater was asked whether the president was concerned that Silverado's collapse might have have been partly due to regulators who were fearful of Neil Bush's role 
Fitzwater replied , These matters are all under investigation and consideration and regulators who were fearful of Neil Bush's role  wo not offer any comment on any aspect of a news conference  
Marlin Fitzwater  might say , Neil's been off that board for a long time 
President Bush is scheduled to visit Denver on Friday
