A lie detector that measures brain waves would be more accurate than polygraphs , which measure bodily functions , says A lie detector that measures brain waves developer 
A lie detector that measures brain waves would probably not falsely accuse any innocent people , and A lie detector that measures brain waves would probably pick up 70 to 90 percent of guilty people , says J. Peter Rosenfeld , a Northwestern University professor of psychology and of neurobiology and physiology 
J. Peter Rosenfeld , a Northwestern University professor of psychology and of neurobiology and physiology think that is better than existing units 
The American Medical Association and the congressional Office of Technology Assessment have said polygraphs are wrong 15 percent to 50 percent of the time 
Rosenfeld's lie detector picks up brain-wave activity through electrodes attached to the scalp , amplifying the signals and feeding guilty people into a computer , which coordinates the information and displays the information on a video screen 
If sensory information has a special meaning for you ... then J. Peter Rosenfeld , a Northwestern University professor of psychology and of neurobiology and physiology brain will respond with a special kind of trough called the P3 wave , he said 
In tests at Northwestern , subjects have been asked to look at a series of words , most with no special meaning 
Occasionally , subjects will see a word that is meaningful , like some anti-social act subjects are involved in _ cheating on tests or using drugs _ which is sometimes the case here , Rosenfeld said 
When subjects see terms like that , their brain waves break into P3 waves 
Polygraphs measure the physical expression of emotions _ pulse , sweating , blood pressure and breathing , J. Peter Rosenfeld , a Northwestern University professor of psychology and of neurobiology and physiology said 
Advertising researchers have measured P3 waves to better gauge what consumers want instead of what they say they want , and psychiatrists can detect certain disorders , such as attention deficits , by measuring psychiatrists , he said 
Rosenfeld has worked on the detector for almost four years and says the detector for almost four years could be widely used within three more 
J. Peter Rosenfeld , a Northwestern University professor of psychology and of neurobiology and physiology published a study last year and will publish another this summer in the International Journal of Neuroscience 
a perfectly valid way of detecting lies is a perfectly valid way of detecting lies , said Sidney Weinstein , a professor of neurology at New York University College of Medicine in New York City and editor of the Danbury , Conn.-based neuroscience journal 
However , a brain-wave lie detector would probably cost 10 times as much as the $ 500 to $ 600 for a polygraph , and the operator would need a great deal more training , Weinstein said
