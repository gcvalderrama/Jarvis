The wife of Capt. Will Rogers III , skipper of the San Diego-based Vincennes , escaped unharmed Friday morning moments before a pipe bomb exploded under her van , igniting a fire that gutted The wife of Capt. Will Rogers III vehicle at a busy La Jolla intersection 
Hours after the 7:40 a.m. explosion , the FBI took control of the investigation , suspecting that the bombing might be an act of domestic terrorism linked to the Vincennesaccidental downing of an Iranian civilian airliner in the Persian Gulf last July , killing 290 
The Navy and Marine Corps tightened security at every military installation in San Diego County 
Certainly The Navy raises the question whether there was a terrorist group involved in this , said Gary Laturno , an FBI spokesman 
No Motive Yet No one claimed responsibility for the bombing , a federal law enforcement official said 
At this point in time , we have no motive ; we have no suspect , said Thomas A. Hughes , special agent in charge of the FBI in San Diego 
We do not rule out the possibility of retribution against Capt. Rogers 
However , a senior Defense Department official said that there was no evidence of a terrorist connection Friday , and some law enforcement officials described the bombing as amateurish 
Nonetheless , federal officials acknowledged that the incident followed an FBI lookout report issued in San Diego in late December for a Syrian national allegedly linked to the Dec. 21 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 that killed 259 passengers and crew members in Scotland last year 
A copy of the FBI document , obtained by The Times , said the Los Angeles FBI office had received an anonymous phone call alleging that the Syrian , identified as Farwan Abdin , was involved in or responsible for the Flight 103 bombing over Scotland 
The FBI added : Also mentioned were Navy quarters or TV station 
No further information given 
The FBI's assessment at the time was that the call was shoddy but that efforts should be made to locate Abdin 
Officials said Friday that a serious investigation of the call was never launched 
The Rogerses were being protected Friday night by the Naval Investigative Service and other Navy personnel at an undisclosed location 
other Navy personnel are not home , and federal officials will not disclose other Navy personnel location , said Chief Craig Huebler , a Navy spokesman 
And federal officials wo not discuss an undisclosed location beyond that 
That gets into security , and you can understand the sensitivity to that 
He said that no special security precautions had been undertaken for Rogers , crew members and their families after the Vincennes returned to San Diego 
Why should the Vincennes crew be treated any different ? 
he said 
There was nothing to indicate a threat to the crew or to its crew members families 
All 360 sailors assigned to the Vincennes were alerted by their commanders Friday morning of the bomb in the Rogersesvan and urged to take whatever precautions their commanders deemed necessary , Huebler said 
Police and Navy officials said Rogers and his wife telephoned Rogers and his wife son , Bill Rogers , at an eastern university , where Capt. Rogers is a student 
Police assured Capt. Rogers that Police were safe 
After the bombing Friday , an FBI spokesman said the Rogersesvan was usually driven by Sharon Rogers , but two highly placed law enforcement sources told The Times that Will Rogers drove Capt. Rogers wife's van to a doughnut shop without incident about an hour before the blast 
The explosion occurred while the van was in the left-turn lane on Genesee Avenue , south of La Jolla Village Drive 
A law enforcement official , who asked not to be identified , said Sharon Rogers told investigators that she pulled up behind three or four cars stopped at a red light at the intersection and then suddenly heard two popping sounds 
The official said Sharon Rogers believed that Sharon Rogers van had been struck in the rear by another car , so Sharon Rogers got out and walked to the back of the van to look for damage 
And then her van all went up , the official said 
That is all there was to her van 
There were holes everywhere , and there was plenty of burn 
The explosion propelled metal fragments through the roof of the white Toyota and ignited a fire that destroyed the vehicle 
One law enforcement source said several construction workers nearby reported that moments after the explosion , a red car quickly made a U-turn over the traffic median on Genesee and sped from the scene 
No other description of the car was available , but witnesses said there were four people in it 
No other description of the car could have been a guy with a remote-control device who popped the bomb , he said , or No other description of the car could have been somebody who saw the explosion and was trying not to get hurt 
Sharon Rogers , 50 , was on Sharon Rogers way to Sharon Rogers job as a fourth-grade teacher at La Jolla Country Day School when the bomb went off 
Other Vehicles Undamaged Though the van was surrounded on three sides by other vehicles , none of witnesses were damaged , witnesses said 
Kurt Lent , a laborer who was walking down a dirt embankment toward the vehicle as it exploded believe Sharon Rogers got out just as the Rogerses ' van blew , said Kurt Lent , a laborer who was walking down a dirt embankment toward the vehicle as it exploded 
Sharon Rogers was dazed but walking under Sharon Rogers own power , when the laborers reached Sharon Rogers 
the laborers took Sharon Rogers to a pickup truck , where Sharon Rogers told the laborers that Sharon Rogers was the van's sole occupant and asked the laborers to call her husband 
Will Rogers arrived at the scene within a few minutes , and police took the couple to the San Diego Police Department's Northern Division headquarters 
the couple looked like the couple would just been rear-ended or something , said Charles Archer , one of two masonry workers to reach Rogers first 
the couple was surprised and shocked , but the couple was not burned and the couple was not bleeding 
San Diego police and FBI agents rushed to the Rogerseshome on Sherlock Court , checking two other vehicles and the home with dogs specially trained to sniff for explosives 
Investigators also used mirrors to look beneath the vehicles 
Two law enforcement sources said Will Rogers left the couple's home about 6:30 a.m. and drove in the van to a doughnut shop 
Capt. Rogers returned , drank coffee with Capt. Rogers wife , and then Sharon Rogers , who usually drove the van , left in the vehicle , investigators said 
When Sharon Rogers was interviewed , one law enforcement source said , Sharon Rogers was nervous and shaken , but Sharon Rogers did not immediately connect the explosion with any possible retaliation for Sharon Rogers husband's role in shooting down the Iranian jetliner 
The official also said that the van had been parked in the driveway overnight , but that neither the Rogerses nor any neighbors reported prowlers near the vehicle 
a federal law enforcement official also said the Rogerses have a family watchdog 
The dog did not bark , and the dog barks at everybody , the official said 
The dog also said Sharon Rogers told investigators that Sharon Rogers family had received no threats since the airplane was downed 
There were no threats , nothing , The dog said 
That is what is funny 
If you are getting telephone calls in the middle of the night and threatening letters and graffiti , you would worry 
But here there was nothing 
Late Friday , the FBI declined comment on most aspects of the investigation , but at a press conference , the FBI's Hughes said , An explosive device exploded in the vehicle 
However , two law enforcement sources said one or two pipe bombs had been placed on the transmission under the van 
If she did not get out like that ... well , she was very , very lucky , one source said 
the FBI 's Hughes said the FBI 's Hughes and other investigators determined that the two initial loud bangs apparently came from one or two explosive devices , and that the apparatus was connected under the van's transmission 
the FBI 's Hughes noted that most of the van's damage resulted from the fire , which the FBI 's Hughes said has led investigators to believe that either low-intensity explosives were planted on the vehicle or that only a small amount of high-intensity explosives were used 
Within hours , San Diego Fire Department officials confirmed that the blast was caused by a pipe bomb 
Archer said Charles Archer found a flattened , 2-by-3-inch section of metal pipe near the curb and turned a flattened , 2-by-3-inch section of metal pipe near the curb over to investigators 
The Vincennes , a guided-missile cruiser based in San Diego , returned from the Vincennes ' six-month Persian Gulf deployment last October 
the Vincennes ' remains in port with Rogers as its skipper 
As the Vincennes exchanged fire with Iranian speedboats last July 3 , Iran Air Flight 655 appeared on the U.S. warship's high-tech radar system 
After the plane failed to respond to warnings on civilian and military channels , Rogers gave the order to fire 
That decision , Capt. Rogers said later , was in defense of Capt. Rogers ship and crew 
But the aircraft that Rogers feared was an Iranian F-14 fighter was actually an Airbus A300 
All aboard were killed when the plane was knocked out of the air by a Vincennes missile 
After the downing of the plane , Iran said the plane would seek retribution for the deaths of the innocent civilians 
No Threats However , Navy spokesmen in San Diego said Friday that no threats had been made against Rogers , the Vincennes or any of its crew members since the ship returned to San Diego 
The Vincennes and Rogers received some negative mail last July , shortly after the Iranian plane was shot down , a spokesman said 
The mail was critical of the Vincenneshandling of the incident but did not contain threats , the spokesman said 
Since the Vincennes returned to San Diego , Rogers has been overseeing routine ship maintenance and training in preparation for the Vincennes ' next deployment 
The Navy does not disclose the dates any of The Navy ships will be deployed , but surface ships normally work in 18-month cycles , spending about six months at sea and the remainder of the time at or near their home ports 
Terrorism experts believe that the bombing of Pan American Flight 103 may have been retribution for the Vincennesshooting down of the Iranian jetliner 
But no organization that authorities thought capable of the act has claimed responsibility for the bombing of the Pan Am aircraft
