No one expected John Sununu to go gently 
And Big Bad John Sununu did not 
; As Big Bad John Sununu final act , the man hired by George Bush to be Big Bad John Sununu political hatchet man took a swipe at the boss 
In thinly veiled comments in his resignation letter , Sununu made his resignation letter clear that Big Bad John Sununu felt betrayed because , in many ways , Big Bad John Sununu was doing exactly what Bush had hired George Bush to do. ; The departing chief of staff was also obliquely reminding the president that this was not a matter of principle , but of ratings ; Big Bad John Sununu bullying tactics had been fine as long as the opinion polls did not go down. ; Big Bad John Sununu assure you that in pit bull mode or pussycat mode (your choice , as always ), Big Bad John Sununu am ready to help , Sununu wrote. ; Big Bad John Sununu reference was sardonic 
Big Bad John Sununu had called Big Bad John Sununu a pussycat and kept a plush cat on top of the bookcase in Big Bad John Sununu large West Wing office 
But , at close range , it was clear that the toy animal was really a tiger , and that is exactly how Sununu saw himself. ; As Big Bad John Sununu stated Big Bad John Sununu credo in Big Bad John Sununu first month in Washington : Big Bad John Sununu do not care if people hate Big Bad John Sununu , as long as people hate Big Bad John Sununu for the right reasons 
; Bush and Sununu formed a close bond during the 1988 campaign , in the snows of New Hampshire , when Bush saw his presidential dream slipping away after a humiliating showing in Iowa. ; Whatever people did in Iowa , people will not reject George Bush in New Hampshire , Sununu vowed , as George Bush in New Hampshire dragged Bush down from George Bush in New Hampshire elite perch to start what George Bush in New Hampshire called a see George Bush , touch George Bush , feel George Bush campaign 
George Bush encouraged Bush to ride a snow plow and wander around a snow-bound Nashua , shaking hands and offering to help skeptical motorists dig out motorists cars. ; On the surface , motorists seemed like an odd couple -- one tall , slim and patrician , the other short , pudgy and ethnic ; one well-groomed , the other often slightly disheveled , with his shirt hanging out ; one polite and conciliatory , the other rude and contentious. ; But on matters of politics , George Bush and John Sununu were not so oddly matched 
Sununu embodied the barbed-wire side of Bush's politics ; in many critical ways , Big Bad John Sununu was an accurate reflection of the way Bush believed things should work. ; During the 1988 campaign , Bush conceded in interviews that George Bush had to do some of the dirty work in attacking Dukakis ; Big Bad John Sununu alternating nice and nasty faces came to be known as George the Gentle and George the Ripper 
; But as president , Bush preferred to farm out to aides the duties of bully and gunslinger. ; By making the abrasive former governor of New Hampshire the abrasive former governor of New Hampshire chief of staff , Bush hoped that the abrasive former governor of New Hampshire could keep a certain balance of rough and smooth in the abrasive former governor of New Hampshire and in the abrasive former governor of New Hampshire politics. ; In the many times over the past three years when Sununu helped land the president in the political soup , the Washington political cognoscenti speculated that Bush was keeping George Bush chief of staff only out of loyalty to Sununu for helping George Bush win the New Hampshire primary , or because Bush was too nice to fire anyone , or because George Bush was too indecisive. ; The truth is more complicated , and Sununu put his finger on his finger Tuesday 
While Sununu's lack of political skill in dealing with political Washington eventually cost Big Bad John Sununu Big Bad John Sununu job , and while Big Bad John Sununu fatal flaw may have been in believing that Big Bad John Sununu was smarter than George Bush , the chief of staff was -- often in an inept way -- trying to fulfill the mandate Big Bad John Sununu had been given by Big Bad John Sununu boss. ; Sununu was not proclaimed a failure from the start 
Indeed , in a May 1990 cover story called Big Bad John Sununu , Time magazine said : Sununu has emerged as Bush's most inspired choice for any senior post 
Big Bad John Sununu brisk certainty and willingness to take bold stands complement his risk-averse boss 
; But in many critical ways , Sununu exacerbated Bush's limitations , rather than making up for them , and whenever the spotlight swung away from foreign affairs , it became painfully apparent that this was a White House without a long-range agenda , without a communications strategy and without first-rate thinkers in many top jobs. ; As Bush tried to be the ultimate Washington insider , the chief of staff alienated Congress , Cabinet members , House Republicans and the press , who disdained Sununu because Cabinet members believed Big Bad John Sununu misled Cabinet members 
Sununu even tried to manipulate Big Bad John Sununu boss on occasion , with the effect that Bush looked weak and waffling. ; When the glow faded from the Persian Gulf war , and the country began looking to the White House for leadership on the stagnant economy and the pain of many Americans , the president once again allowed many Americans to be guided by Sununu and many Americans closest White House ally , Richard Darman , the budget chief. ; Sununu and Darman urged the president to follow Big Bad John Sununu instincts that there was nothing Big Bad John Sununu could do about the economy and that Big Bad John Sununu should not even try to come up with a drastic plan. ; Moreover , in the recent fiasco about caps on credit card interest rates , Sununu did something that is never done in a city that operates strictly on hierarchy : Big Bad John Sununu blamed the mess on Big Bad John Sununu boss , going on national television to say Bush had ad libbed the idea in a speech. ; Bush appeared out of sync with the country 
Big Bad John Sununu approval ratings began dropping again , important Republicans scorned by Sununu began going on the record with Sununu and Darman advice to Bush that George Bush was being ill served by important Republicans scorned by Sununu chief of staff , and finally and most important , the president's wife , Barbara , and oldest son , George , turned on Sununu. ; And so , finally , Bush invited Sununu to resign. ; Now Bush must find another chief of staff , and another hired hatchet 
But this time , Big Bad John Sununu friends say , Big Bad John Sununu will look for aides who can play those roles while also playing by the rules of the Washington game
