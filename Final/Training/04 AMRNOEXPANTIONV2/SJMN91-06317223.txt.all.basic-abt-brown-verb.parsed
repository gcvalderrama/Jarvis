# ::snt The project began with much fanfare in September when four men and four women , accompanied by 3,000 species of plants and animals , sealed themselves inside a eight-story glass structure for a two-year experiment in biological recycling. ; The allegations of misrepresentation involve a device that removes carbon dioxide from the air and turns it into a solid for storage inside the Biosphere. ; Carbon dioxide is exhaled by humans and metabolized by plants. ; The current issue of the Village Voice says the group secretly installed the device , violating the advertised goal of recycling all materials naturally. ; The Voice also said the levels of carbon dioxide in Biosphere 2 were becoming dangerously high , apparently because of the decrease in sunlight and the resulting decline in photosynthetic activity by the plants. ; Kathleen Dyhr , a Biosphere spokeswoman , said in a telephone interview that the group had indeed installed a carbon dioxide remover. ; She conceded that it was not natural but called it a minor aid to help stabilize the atmosphere during its initial fluctuations
