What is On in Las Vegas is a handy biweekly magazine that lists not only entertainment and other attractions around the city, but offers much helpful general information, too 
In its regular feature, What is On for the Young at Heart, it reports that seniors get 25 % off regular rates at the St. Tropez Hotel, an all-suite, non-gaming hotel on Harmon Avenue off the Strip 
Since the offer is subject to room availability, reservations are suggested 
The Palace Station, also off the Strip on Sahara Avenue near Interstate 15, offers seniors a $ 30 rate Sunday through Thursday 
And the Four Queens in downtown Las Vegas has a $ 35 rate during the same time period 
For low-cost senior dining, the magazine suggests, among other places, the downtown Gold Strike Inn, which has a $ 1.99 senior dinner buffet from 3 to 10 p.m. Tuesday and Thursday 
The magazine also tells about the Southern Nevada University of Cosmetology, which gives a 20 % discount on all services Thursday and Friday to those 60 years and older 
The Academy of Hair Design offers a similar discount on Tuesday and Wednesday, but sets the age at 62 and older 
The column also tells of the Las Vegas Transit System's sizable senior offer, cited in this column before but worth repeating 
All that is necessary is a Medicare card to get a 10-ride pass for $ 4.20 
A regular Las Vegas bus ride is $ 1.10 
The magazine also informs readers of discounts on rental cars, motor scooters, even wheelchairs for $ 5 a day 
Other senior deals are for bowling, shopping and various attractions 
Seniors can pick up a copy at any hotel in Las Vegas or send $ 2.50 to What is On in Las Vegas Magazine, 610 S. Third St., Las Vegas, Nev. 89101 
Also from Las Vegas is a $ 2 reference guide published by the Las Vegas Advisor 
It is not specifically for mature travelers, but has good tips for those looking for the best deals in meals and entertainment 
The small-but-handy, single-sheet guide includes other senior-oriented data, such as the five casinos in town with penny slots 
Other features are the costs of all Las Vegas production shows, plus a map and toll-free numbers for all casinos and other travel services

At check-in, guests also receive a Golden Guest card that allows additional discounts at selected Sheraton restaurants and shows, as well as more savings from local merchants and services 
The 140 Rodeway Inns have been sold to Quality Inns, bringing the chain's number of hotels to more than 1,700
