Former Rep. Thomas Ashley, a longtime friend of President Bush, confirmed today that he is been giving advice to Neil Bush since last winter on the controversy surrounding the president son's role in the collapse of a Denver savings and loan 
But Ashley, a banking lobbyist, denied that Bush had asked him to contact his son 
That is absolutely inaccurate, Ashley said in an interview 
I am to smart to do that 
The Denver Post reported in today's editions that Ashley, a college classmate of George Bush's from Yale, had talked to the younger Bush at the president's behest before Neil Bush was questioned by federal banking regulators 
The newspaper attributed the report to comments by Neil Bush himself, contained in a deposition taken by the Office of Thrift Supervision 
If Neil thinks his father called me, he is mistaken, Ashley said 
Ashley, 67, a Democrat, is a former congressman from Ohio 
He is currently president of the Association of Bank Holding Companies, a banking lobbying organization based in Washington 
Neil Bush faces a public disciplinary hearing before federal regulators in September on his role as a director of the bankrupt Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan 
Ashley said that he contacted Neil Bush on his own last winter after reading about his troubles in the paper 
Since then, I have seen Neil a half dozen times 
We talk about it, Ashley said 
He said that, although President Bush did not ask him to contact Neil Bush, the president is aware that he has been counselling the son 
Bush has pledged not to get personally involved in the investigation of his son 
Ashley said I do not think the president has any problem with the fact that he has involved himself in the matter 
What he feels is I am a longtime friend of Neil's 
Is everyone who is close to the president supposed to stay away from Neil ? 
Ashley asked 
President Bush does not go along with that 
He rejects that, Ashley said 
I have talked to the president (about the situation )on a couple of social occasions, when we are alone, including once at Camp David, Ashley said 
I talk about the kids 
Neil's one of the kids 
Ashley said that Neil has made his own decisions in the matter 
What we do is talk about the consequences of one course or another, Ashley said 
Ashley said that his own experience in politics and in bank regulation make him a good source for advice for Neil Bush 
The situation is such that he ca not go to his father and talk to him, Ashley said 
It is not a partisan matter or he would not be coming to a Democrat, Ashley added 
It is just a situation where somebody he is known for a long time is available and has experience in matters involving regulatory matters 
I am a good sounding board, Ashley added 
Ashley said that Neil Bush decided on his own not to take the easy way out and that he is been the victim of a little selective treatment from federal regulators 
But, Ashley said, He has not whined or complained about that 
He said that Neil Bush was concerned that when the Office of Thrift Supervision decided to go public about the case, it only presented its side of the matter 
A thousand pages 
It did not include Neil's defense 
Ashley and Bush have remained close friends since they were both members of the secret society Skull and Bones while they were undergraduates at Yale University in the late 1940s
