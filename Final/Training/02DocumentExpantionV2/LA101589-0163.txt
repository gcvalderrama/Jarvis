Michael Milken may be gone from Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. , but Michael Milken  deal-making days are not done 
On the eighth floor of the United Artists building on North Roxbury Drive in Beverly Hills , just a couple of blocks from Michael Milken  old perch on Drexel's junk bond trading desk , carpets have been laid , wallpaper is up and furniture delivered 
Milken's new company , International Capital Access Group , is open for business 
Despite the racketeering and securities fraud indictment hanging over Michael Milken  and Michael Milken  forced resignation from Drexel in June , Milken has not retreated to the sidelines 
When Drexel's former junk bond chief announced plans for the firm , Drexel's former junk bond chief  said Drexel's  would help members of minority groups and unions raise the capital to own companies 
And , four months after four months  was founded , ICAG appears to be doing just that 
But the new firm is also gearing up for a considerable amount of potentially more profitable business 
Since leaving Drexel , Milken has had talks with many of his old firm's clients , according to a senior Drexel executive 
And in a long interview in ICAG's offices , Milken confirmed that a significant part of ICAG's business will be with ordinary companies 
ICAG's  may make direct investments in companies 
And ICAG's  is working on finding new capital for successful companies and refinancing firms that are in trouble 
In exchange for Milken's brainpower and contacts in arranging refinancing , ICAG expects to receive an ownership stake in most of the companies that an ownership stake  helps 
What the companies  are doing here is pretty much what we were doing before (at Drexel ), in the sense that his focus is on finding ways for companies to raise capital , Milken says , although he no longer trades or underwrites securities 
Milken , however , protests any suggestion that the firm's main purpose is to make money 
All of its activities , Michael Milken  says , fall under the category of helping people 
Michael Milken  refuses to discuss ICAG's fees or even confirm that Michael Milken  expects the company to be profitable 
Financial reporters have this preoccupation with money , Michael Milken  says 
We are focused on creating value 
Wealth is a byproduct 
Several times during the interview , the man who earned $ 550 million in one year at Drexel , and is estimated to be worth well over $ 1 billion , complained that people are so hung up on money 
At Drexel , Milken essentially created the market for high-yield , high-risk junk bonds , and Michael Milken  revolutionized the way that capital was raised for medium-sized U.S. companies 
Michael Milken  also turned junk bonds into a potent tool in corporate takeovers and leveraged buyouts 
Now , Milken seems determined to prove that the government's case against Michael Milken  will not stop Michael Milken  from carrying out Michael Milken  ideas 
An ordinary person might be overwhelmed by the chore of preparing a legal defense against a 98-count felony indictment 
But Stephen Weinroth , a longtime Drexel official now on leave , says : Mike has an energy level that makes a nuclear plant look pathetic 
In the short time since ICAG was formed , the time  already has purchased $ 2.5 million worth of barges and other equipment to lease to Unimar International Inc. , a Seattle-based shipbuilder and tugboat company that was bought out by its unionized employees with Drexel's help in 1987 
Milken says ICAG plans to do this for other employee-owned companies as well , since many of them have trouble raising the money to buy equipment outright 
Among activities involving minorities , Milken has put groups of minority businessmen in contact with potential backers 
And Bill Tatum , publisher of New York's black newspaper , the Amsterdam News , says Bill Tatum  met with Milken about backing for a bid on a major general-circulation newspaper , perhaps the troubled Daily News 
Milken says that helping unions and members of minority groups , and devising ways to help indebted countries , such as Mexico , will make up more than half of ICAG's business 
In addition to these areas , Milken already is doing a considerable amount of mainstream business 
Michael Milken  says Michael Milken  has agreed to help recapitalize an entertainment and publishing concern , which Michael Milken  wo not identify 
Michael Milken  is working on bailing out Weintraub Entertainment Group , a Los Angeles company that was straining under its junk bond debt after a string of unsuccessful movies 
Michael Milken  is helping to arrange financing for a Los Angeles chain of car dealerships 
And Michael Milken  says that enough progress has been made on some deals that they may soon be announced publicly 
Milken says that , in all , Michael Milken  has been approached by several hundred companies 
Of these , ICAG is doing work on behalf of about 30 
Michael Milken  says that 12 of these already are at the point where a transaction has occurred or is about to 
Milken wo not comment on the terms on which ICAG is helping these companies , but one deal that fell through suggests that , while Michael Milken  aim may be to help others , Michael Milken  is not neglecting Michael Milken  own interests 
Wolfgang Puck , the well-known chef and proprietor of the Los Angeles restaurant Spago , said Wolfgang Puck  approached Milken in July about raising new financing for Puck's frozen pizza venture , Wolfgang Puck Food Co. 
In an interview , Puck said Wolfgang Puck  was not able to come to terms with ICAG 
Puck said Wolfgang Puck  balked when Milken demanded a majority stake in the company 
Milken says Michael Milken  was not directly involved in the Puck negotiations , and denies that Wolfgang Puck , the well-known chef and proprietor of the Los Angeles restaurant Spago  fell through because of the ownership issue 
Michael Milken  says Puck's company at the time was in financial difficulties and needed a lot of financing 
(Puck's company at the time  has since obtained some financing elsewhere )
Michael Milken  says that the talks broke down because Wolfgang Puck , the well-known chef and proprietor of the Los Angeles restaurant Spago  involved too many lenders and stockholders who simply could not come to terms on a variety of issues 
Milken's challenge in establishing a new firm will be to overcome serious handicaps imposed by Michael Milken  pending criminal prosecution 
ICAG can not trade or underwrite securities 
Such activities were a main part of Milken's activities at Drexel 
But they require licensing by the Securities and Exchange Commission 
From a legal standpoint , Milken could apply for such licenses , since Michael Milken  has yet to be convicted of anything 
For practical reasons , however , Michael Milken  has chosen not to , and so must rely on other firms to perform these services for Michael Milken  clients 
Asked if a legal standpoint  bothers Michael Milken  that Michael Milken  can no longer issue new securities , Milken says , a legal standpoint  is not something Michael Milken  am thinking about at this time 
Investment banking sources say that Milken , in effect , also is closed out of doing work for the gambling industry , which made up a big share of Michael Milken  clients at Drexel 
Because Michael Milken  is under indictment , New Jersey and Nevada gaming authorities have indicated that New Jersey and Nevada gaming authorities  might take legal steps against casino operators who do business with Michael Milken  
And though Milken's press spokesman and personal lawyer strongly deny New Jersey  , a number of potential clients are frightened of having Milken's press spokesman and personal lawyer  names publicly associated with Milken's press spokesman  
In an off-the-record interview , the chief executive of a publicly traded company who was a client of Milken's at Drexel and praises Milken effusively said that the chief executive of a publicly traded company who was a client of Milken's at Drexel and praises Milken effusively  could not afford to have any formal business relationship with ICAG 
the chief executive of a publicly traded company who was a client of Milken's at Drexel and praises Milken effusively  said the commercial banks with which the chief executive of a publicly traded company who was a client of Milken's at Drexel and praises Milken effusively  company does business have indicated that Milken's press spokesman and personal lawyer  might stop lending to the chief executive of a publicly traded company who was a client of Milken's at Drexel and praises Milken effusively  if the chief executive of a publicly traded company who was a client of Milken's at Drexel and praises Milken effusively  does 
Some banks , the chief executive of a publicly traded company who was a client of Milken's at Drexel and praises Milken effusively  said , have decided that Milken is not a credible person right now 
This has not stopped a flood of companies that have approached the chief executive of a publicly traded company who was a client of Milken's at Drexel and praises Milken effusively  in confidence , however 
And there are still plenty of well-known executives who praise Milken publicly and wish Michael Milken  company success 
Steven J. Ross , co-chairman of the recently merged Time Warner Inc. , said : Mike has to be one of the most brilliant financial minds of well-known executives  time 
But Ross would not say if Steven J. Ross  expects to use ICAG's services 
well-known executives  have factors that well-known executives  never make public about any of well-known executives  business dealings , Steven J. Ross  said , adding : That is not to be construed that well-known executives  are or are not 
In true Milken style , ICAG's new offices are comfortable but not ostentatious 
Only the firm's name , not Milken's , is on the door 
And Michael Milken  refers to everyone who works there as co-workers , not employees 
The heart of the firm is a long rectangular table made up of 18 wooden desks pushed together 
Complete with financial data computer screens , a long rectangular table made up of 18 wooden desks pushed together  looks remarkably like a trading desk 
It is an environment that evidently makes Milken feel at home ; Michael Milken  years in Drexel's Beverly Hills office were spent at the center of the junk bond trading desk 
But at this one , for the foreseeable future , no securities will be traded 
The firm currently has about 20 employees , with more expected to join soon 
(Milken says Michael Milken  does not know how many )
Among the top staff members , whom Milken calls principals , are Steven Fink , a former official at Pacific Asset Holdings (a partnership in which Milken holds an interest ), Lorraine Spurge , formerly one of his top assistants at Drexel , and Randolph Read , former president of a merchant banking concern 
Officials at the new firm say Officials at the new firm  are are not making overtures to lure Drexel employees to ICAG 
But Milken does not rule out talking to former Drexel colleagues who may , on their own , contact Michael Milken  about a job 
Michael Milken  refuses to discuss how much capital the firm has , a key measure of the potential scope of its activities 
how much capital the firm has , a key measure of the potential scope of its activities  is a private firm , Michael Milken  says 
Milken did say that all of the firm's capital comes from himself and the principal staff members , not outsiders 
There are a number of people who have called , but outsiders  felt a number of people who have called  would be better that outsiders  did not take in outside backers , Michael Milken  said 
But one clue to the amount of money that Milken personally is committing to the firm is how much Michael Milken  says ICAG is willing to invest in an individual transaction 
For most types of transactions , Michael Milken  says , the firm stands ready to invest between $ 500,000 and $ 20 million 
Milken draws a sharp distinction between Michael Milken  goals and those of Bruce Wasserstein and Joseph R. Perella , formerly of First Boston Corp. , who , like Milken , left a big Wall Street firm to set up shop on their own 
Their new firm , Wasserstein Perella & Co. , was established as a corporate takeover boutique 
In contrast , Milken says , you will not find us involved in any unfriendly transactions 
Although Milken is credited with inventing the use of junk bonds to back hostile corporate raids , Michael Milken  maintains that hostile transactions have never been a major focus of mine 
Milken adds : There is so much we can do to help people , Michael Milken  just do not think the use of junk bonds  is something we are interested in 
By helping companies , Milken means suggesting ways that companies  could improve companies  basic business , working out creative means of raising capital or recapitalizing to reduce interest costs , and using Michael Milken  vast network of contacts to put companies in touch with potential investors 
After a speech Michael Milken  made in September , Milken was widely quoted as suggesting that companies should now attempt to reduce companies  level of high-yield debt 
Some analysts interpreted this as a major reversal , since Milken's later years at Drexel were largely spent promoting leveraged buyouts financed with huge chunks of junk-bond debt 
But Milken maintains that Michael Milken  is simply doing what Michael Milken  has always done , advising companies to profit from market conditions 
One service that ICAG expects to perform is finding creative ways for its customers to convert their costly high-interest debt into a combination of lower-interest debt and equity that is , stock 
Milken says Michael Milken  firm expects to help salvage some of the large companies that have been in the news in the last couple of months because of severe difficulties in meeting the payments on their junk debt 
There are some companies today that are not knocking the cover off the ball , and yes , we are willing to help , Michael Milken  says 
Milken declines to discuss individual companies but denies that the debt per se caused individual companies  problems 
As ICAG takes on customers , one thorny issue is one thorny issue  relations with current Drexel customers 
When Drexel settled a massive SEC lawsuit , the firm agreed not to do business directly or indirectly with Milken 
What this means precisely has not been defined and could be a source of further SEC action 
It is not clear , for example , whether legal problems would arise if a company hired Drexel to underwrite securities according to a recapitalization plan drawn up by Milken 
Milken's lawyers are interpreting the provision to be Drexel's problem , not Michael Milken  
(A Milken adviser notes that Milken is not a party to the settlement with the SEC )
Still , the adviser acknowledges that the settlement with the SEC  is something that exists , and Milken's lawyers  are conscious of the settlement with the SEC  
Some current Drexel clients say Some current Drexel clients  would not be troubled by feelings of disloyalty if Some current Drexel clients  also decided to seek help from ICAG 
Oscar U. Mutz , president and chief executive of Forum Group , an Indianapolis developer of retirement communities that is a Drexel customer , says : Oscar U. Mutz , president and chief executive of Forum Group , an Indianapolis developer of retirement communities that is a Drexel customer  do not ask Drexel's permission to go see Morgan Stanley (another Wall Street investment bank ), and Oscar U. Mutz , president and chief executive of Forum Group , an Indianapolis developer of retirement communities that is a Drexel customer  do not ask Drexel's permission to go see Michael Milken or anybody else 
Mutz , however , says Oscar U. Mutz  has not yet had occasion to do business with ICAG 
Steven Anreder , Drexel's spokesman , says the firm has not lost any clients to ICAG 
And Steven Anreder  said Steven Anreder  does not expect conflicts to develop 
Milken , who was one of the most feared competitors on Wall Street when Michael Milken  was at Drexel , now frequently is funneling to other firms the trading and underwriting business that Michael Milken  can no longer do Michael Milken  
One ICAG staff member says Milken's old competitors today are more than happy to do business with Michael Milken  , now that Michael Milken  is no longer directly competing 
The reality is that Milken's old competitors  can generate a lot of business for people , the staff member says 
Milken One ICAG staff member  takes pains to downplay Michael Milken  former role as competitor , saying that as a former buyer and seller of securities , Michael Milken  always had to maintain good relationships with other firms 
One big , unanswered question is what will become of the firm if Milken is convicted and sent to prison 
Michael Milken  trial is scheduled for March , and Michael Milken  faces the possibility of a lengthy sentence 
Michael Milken  denies any wrongdoing and is vigorously fighting the charges 
Milken and staff members say the top staff members , whom Milken calls principals ,  are hoping for the best and , no matter what happens , the top staff members , whom Milken calls principals ,  expect ICAG to remain in business and grow 
Meanwhile , Time Warner's Ross says : Michael Milken  is got such a brilliant mind that Time Warner's Ross  think Michael Milken  could do 10 things at one time and still prepare for what Michael Milken  is about to undergo
