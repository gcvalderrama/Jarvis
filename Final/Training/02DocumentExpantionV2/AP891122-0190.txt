Botanist Linda Leigh , who has spent the last three weeks literally in Linda Leigh  element , called Linda Leigh  stay in an experimental biosphere a success Wednesday but said Linda Leigh  is ready to return to Earth 
When Ms. Leigh exits Thanksgiving afternoon from 21 days inside an airtight , 17,000-cubic foot glass-and-steel structure , Linda Leigh  will have been the longest inhabitant of a completely enclosed ecosystem , with air and water generated and recycled independently of Earth's 
Linda Leigh  will be emerging tomorrow at 2 p.m. as scheduled , and everything is rolling , Linda Leigh  said 
Ms. Leigh has been living inside a test module for Biosphere II , a $ 30 million project under construction 
Scientists plan to place four men and four women inside a much larger sealed structure for two years to determine whether humans can duplicate Earth's life systems for possible use in space 
The one thing that I really do miss is just companionship , Ms. Leigh said Wednesday in a telephone interview from within the module , located on a ranch about 30 miles north of Tucson 
Linda Leigh  do not think that The one thing that I really do miss  is a matter of feeling lonely , but there is just something about direct human contact and sitting with somebody and pouring Scientists  a cup of tea or a cup of coffee and having that morning discussion ; morning discussion  is very different than doing morning discussion  over the phone or over the video , Linda Leigh  said 
Other than that , Linda Leigh  am quite content on the inside 
Linda Leigh  feel like Linda Leigh  could stay in here indefinitely 
Since entering the module Nov. 2 , Ms. Leigh has been in frequent daily contact with her outside support team by telephone , video conference , two-way radio and just looking through the glass windows 
Three daily medical checks , including pulse at rest and after exercise , blood pressure , pulmonary function , blood oxygen saturation and urine tests , have shown Linda Leigh  health is unbelievably positive 
The physicians on the outside ca not believe it , Linda Leigh  said 
Two people also check Linda Leigh  psychologically each day , Ms. Leigh said , just to make sure that Linda Leigh  state of mind or humor is normal 
Ms. Leigh baked Linda Leigh  a 39th birthday cake on Nov. 12 of sorghum , rice flour and sweet potatoes harvested from Linda Leigh  mini-field 
Linda Leigh  colleagues serenaded Linda Leigh  with Happy Birthday by video and directed Linda Leigh  to gifts hidden in her living area 
Other crops have ranged from jalapeno peppers to kohlrabi 
Lemon grass , mint , tarragon and fennel are among the herbs Linda Leigh  has used to season Linda Leigh  meals and make tea 
Linda Leigh  also has a tank of talapia fish 
Linda Leigh  had talapia Vera Cruzana the other night , Linda Leigh  said 
Water for drinking , cooking and showering is dehumidified from the air 
Samples are passed through a special port for outside analysis , along with samples of waste water and Linda Leigh  urine 
The rest of the waste water is fed into a marsh recycling system 
The botanist also has had to be a mechanic and technician , repairing the loose belt of a large fan that heats and cools the module , and fine-tuning the irrigation system 
Ms. Leigh said Linda Leigh  has not felt isolated because Linda Leigh  support team is excellent 
In fact , Linda Leigh  occasionally has had to pull the curtains in her living area to get away from the observing eyes outside 
Either that , or Linda Leigh  go out into what a mechanic and technician  call the wilderness and just stay out within the plants
