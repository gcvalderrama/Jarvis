The Jail Neil Bush posters have sprouted around town , making posters  way from the bohemian side streets of Dupont Circle to the broad avenues of the capital's downtown 
The third son of George and Barbara Bush has become , literally , the poster boy of the nation's savings and loan scandal , The third son of George and Barbara Bush  patrician face plastered on lamp posts in a parody of an FBI Wanted handbill 
His family name , which catapulted him into the altitudes of wealth and power in Denver five years ago , now has thrown The third son of George and Barbara Bush  into the vortex of public controversy 
In August 1985 , with scant banking experience behind The third son of George and Barbara Bush  , Neil Bush joined the board of directors of Silverado Banking , Savings and Loan Association , a Denver thrift that went bust three years later at a cost to taxpayers of $ 1 billion 
Now Bush stands accused by thrift regulators of conflict of interest for not disclosing business links to big Silverado borrowers _ Neil Bush  denies any wrongdoing 
Neil Bush  also could be a target of a negligence lawsuit that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is considering filing against Neil Bush  and other Silverado directors 
Federal investigators are looking into thousands of cases of S&L fraud and mismanagement , and scores of similar lawsuits could be filed by the FDIC 
But Neil Bush's case is different 
As a symbol of the thrift crisis , Neil Bush  could become a political liability for his father and the Republican Party in a $ 500-billion campaign issue 
Neil Mallon Bush , born on Jan. 22 , 1955 , was recently described by the president as probably the most sensitive of the four boys , maybe the second-most sensitive , a good kid 
the president as probably the most sensitive of the four boys , maybe the second-most sensitive  childhood problems with dyslexia inspired the president as probably the most sensitive of the four boys , maybe the second-most sensitive  mother's avid interest in reading programs 
the president as probably the most sensitive of the four boys , maybe the second-most sensitive  was 30 years old when the president as probably the most sensitive of the four boys , maybe the second-most sensitive  joined the Silverado board _ a tender age to assume such a position of trust at a federally insured institution 
Only 1 percent of all savings and loan directors were under 35 in 1988 , according to a survey by the U.S. League of Savings Institutions 
The average age of a thrift director was 57 
Bush's only work in banking before becoming a Silverado director was a summer job at Republic National Bank in Dallas 
Neil Bush  worked in the trust department filling out forms , Neil Bush  told regulators in a closed hearing last December 
The regulators have asserted Bush was unqualified and untrained to be a savings and loan director _ although that does not excuse Neil Bush  , thrift regulators of conflict of interest  said 
Flashback to the heady days of the oil industry in the American West in the early 1980s 
The Iranian oil cutoff in 1979 had spawned skyrocketing prices and long , aggravating waits in gasoline lines at home 
The rugged oil fields of Colorado and Wyoming , which overnight had become economic to develop , were gripped by a gold rush fever 
Suddenly , Colorado  seemed , everyone was in the oil business 
Legions of brash entrepreneurs swept into town , eager to take risks and get a piece of the action 
Neil Bush was one of them 
Neil Bush  came to Denver armed with a bachelor's degree and an MBA , both from Tulane University in New Orleans , and some experience working in Neil Bush  father's 1980 presidential campaign and Neil Bush  brother George's unsuccessful bid for Congress in Texas 
In the summer of 1980 , Bush was hired as a landman by Amoco Production Co. in Denver , negotiating oil leases 
Neil was very , very tough , said Tom Vessels , a Denver oilman who negotiated lease deals with Bush 
Neil Bush  also was all-round curious , asking more questions than most landmen , recalled Vessels , who owns a small oil company bearing Neil Bush  name and is president of the Independent Petroleum Association of Mountain States 
Few others in what is now left of the Rockies oil industry seem to remember Bush 
That is not surprising , since there were scores of small independent oilmen in the region in those days 
Bill Owens , executive director of the Colorado Petroleum Association  have never known anybody who is dealt with Neil Bush  in the oil business , said Bill Owens , executive director of the Colorado Petroleum Association 
Bush left Amoco in late 1982 and set up an oil partnership with two geologists called JNB Exploration Co. 
For an investment of only $ 100 , Bush acquired 23.4 percent of the business 
For two years , JNB drilled a succession of dry holes in Wyoming's Powder River Basin and failed to become profitable 
That was common in those days 
What was unusual , oilmen say , was how Bush's silent partners kept pumping money into the business despite the oil business  track record 
The fact that Bush was a son of the vice president likely had something to do with that 
His silent partners in JNB _ wealthy Denver developers Kenneth M. Good and Bill L. Walters _ probably reckoned His silent partners in JNB _  might get more than oil from the millions of dollars His silent partners in JNB _  invested in Bush's company 
Influence and connections can often be as valuable as money to people like Good and Walters , who were already heavy borrowers from high-flying Silverado when Bush joined the board 
Michael R. Wise , the chairman of Silverado at the time , also knew the value of connections 
Michael R. Wise  was on the board of the U.S. League , the S&L industry's main lobbying group , and had personal contacts with regulators 
In mid-1985 , Wise invited Bush to join the board of Silverado , which was at the zenith of high-flying Silverado  go-go period 
Silverado was making huge loans for grandiose real estate schemes right and left , though many of the ventures were never finished 
The thrift was a gold mine for fast-and-loose developers , since a gold mine for fast-and-loose developers  was playing with depositorsmoney that was insured by the federal government 
Good and Walters , two of the biggest borrowers , got a combined $ 117 million in loans that they never repaid 
The leading borrower , Bell Savings and Loan Association of San Mateo , Calif. , got $ 124.8 million 
Bell Savings and Loan Association of San Mateo , Calif.  chairman at the time , David Butler , pleaded guilty last year to loan fraud and was sentenced to two years in prison 
Management of Silverado took excessive risks , engaged in abusive or questionable practices to generate short-term gains and undertook innovative manipulations to avoid recording losses , the Office of Thrift Supervision said in a report published last May 
The board did little beyond rubber stamping the activities of (Silverado's )sophisticated , bright and manipulative management team 
As a director , Bush voted to approve loans _ including some of the projects sponsored by Good and Walters 
The regulators have accused a director  of conflict of interest in not disclosing to Silverado a director  links with the two developers through JNB 
Bush denies the allegations 
Neil Bush  concedes , however , that Neil Bush  family ties helped Neil Bush  get the Silverado position 
a director  would be naive if a director  were to sit here and deny that the Bush name did not have something to do with the Bush name  , a director  said in a recent interview with Time magazine 
Maybe the advantage of being part of the vice president's family at the time was that a director  was accepted more quickly in terms of age and years in this community (Denver )than others of a director  peer group 
The family name , however , has become a double-edged sword 
Because Neil Bush  is the president's son , Bush has captured the public imagination more than any other player in the national S&L drama 
The unsigned Jail Neil Bush posters have not reached Main Street , but across the country , Neil Bush's face is now recognized by many of the taxpayers who will have to shell out $ 2,000 each to cover thrift losses
