With a recession comes the blame , followed by the blame-shifters 
In Washington now , the shiftiest are passing the scapegoat to the Federal Reserve , and especially Washington  chairman , Alan Greenspan 
There have even been rumblings he wo not be reappointed for a second four-year term , beginning in August 
Administration officials insist he is still the likeliest choice , though the deal is never over until the thin man in the Oval Office sings 
The thin man likes Mr. Greenspan more than is widely known 
But the mere hint that the thin man in the Oval Office  might be replaced shows how little Washington has learned from 20 years of economic turmoil 
Chairman Greenspan is actually President Bush's biggest economic asset 
Yet having pushed Mr. Greenspan out to sea to steer the U.S. economy with only a single oar monetary policy the kibitzers in Congress and the White House are now telling Alan Greenspan  how to row 
And if Alan Greenspan  form is not perfect , the kibitzers in Congress  jeer and then threaten to get a new oarsman 
In other words , the same crowd that raised taxes three months into a recession is now lecturing the one Washington official who inspires confidence in financial markets 
If Mr. Bush wants to kill what everyone hopes is an incipient recovery , President Bush's  could certainly do an incipient recovery  by dumping Mr. Greenspan 
In a town where integrity breeds enemies , Mr. Greenspan has shown too much character 
Alan Greenspan  and Alan Greenspan  Fed allies have not laid down and played the usual game of roll-the-Fed 
Last year's budget deal was supposed to open the money spigots , or so the White House promised 
But unlike the Bush Treasury , the Greenspan Fed remembers the 1970s , when roll-the-Fed produced inflationary booms followed by ever-nastier busts 
Enough of Bush Treasury  members know that the Fed's main task is to keep prices stable ; stimulating economic growth is the job of fiscal policy 
Mr. Bush's economic advisers either do not understand this , or wo not admit it lest Mr. Bush's economic advisers  accept blame for Mr. Bush's economic advisers  own fiscal abdication 
It is so much easier to bash the Fed 
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady spent most of April lobbying for easier money , even if a little more inflation had to go along with a little more inflation  
The Japanese and Germans first turned Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady  down , so Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady  leaned on the Fed 
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady  even made phone calls to two Fed governors to urge two Fed governors  to ease , as columnists Evans and Novak report 
The governors agreed , but for two Fed governors  own economic reasons 
Governor Wayne Angell dissented less for policy reasons than to warn administration inflationists 
Congress is a co-conspirator because Congress  too is in fiscal gridlock 
Larry Lindsey , a White House aide and new nominee to the Fed board , went for Larry Lindsey  Senate hearing last week and allowed that the Fed could have eased more last year 
The inflation monster was still not appeased ; every Banking Committee senator but Florida Republican Connie Mack griped or ranted for easier money 
Mr. Greenspan is well liked on the Hill , but Congress still would not mind an easy-money replacement 
Even the corporate elite are scapegoat hunting 
The Business Council , composed of men who never object to higher taxes on working stiffs , is whining about Mr. Greenspan 
The Fed should ease more and bring interest rates down , says James Robinson , the American Express chairman 
Amex shareholders can only hope Mr. Robinson knows more about finance than James Robinson  does about monetary policy 
Mr. Greenspan's main defenders are the financial markets , and ultimately the American middle class 
Lawrence Kudlow , the Bear Stearns economist , calls Fed performance under Mr. Greenspan uniformly constructive 
Inflation has fallen from the oil-price spikes in October to an annualized rate of less than 3 % 
The Fed's real struggle has been to get long-term interest rates , the main engine of a recovery , to fall too 
That takes art as well as science 
The Fed can tinker with short-term rates , but long-term rates carry an inflation premium and so do not always fall in lock-step 
They may even rise if investors think the Fed is being rolled by the White House 
The fact that long-term rates rose after the last Fed easing , on April 30 , is one reason the Fed is believed not to have eased again this week 
this political factor that argues most for Mr. Greenspan's reappointment  is this political factor that argues most for Mr. Greenspan's reappointment 
Any replacement will be seen as a victory for the cause of roll-the-Fed 
One possible alternative , New York Federal Reserve Bank President Gerald Corrigan , is widely seen as Mr. Brady's ally ; if Gerald Corrigan  is nominated , invest in deutschmarks 
A second possibility , current Fed governor and former Treasury aide David Mullins , has shown signs of independence but not yet enough for the big job 
Former Fed vice chairman Manuel Johnson is popular in the White House , but vice chairman Manuel Johnson  is also seen as highly political 
In short , any replacement would spend months or years winning credibility in financial markets that Mr. Greenspan has already earned 
The marketspolitical sensitivity is a signal that the American middle class does not want the American middle class  wealth robbed again by a new inflation 
If the recession persists longer than the White House expects , the solution lies in a new fiscal policy , such as a renewed campaign to cut capital-gains taxes 
(Mr. Greenspan recommends a zero capital-gains rate )
a zero capital-gains rate  wo not help Mr. Bush to fire the one economic-policy official who is learned something from the past 20 years
