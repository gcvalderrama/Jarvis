Employees at businesses ranging from retail operations to Wall Street brokerage firms will soon be much less likely to have to play truth or consequences with lie detectors 
A bill signed into law Monday by President Reagan will sharply restrict employersuse of polygraph tests 
Currently , about two million U.S. workers annually take such tests when applying for jobs or when companies are investigating theft or other employee violations 
The new law , which becomes effective on Dec. 27 , bars pre-hiring polygraph screening and random testing , and it sets strict rules about giving the tests to workers suspected of a particular wrongdoing 
Some businesses , including pharmaceutical companies and many firms that provide security guards for operations related to health and safety , are exempt from the ban 
Critics of polygraph testing , who claim polygraph testing  is both unreliable and subject to potential abuse , are welcoming the restrictions 
But many employers as well as many of the outside companies that typically administer the tests argue that the measure will crimp security 
many employers as well as many of the outside companies that typically administer the tests  insist that lie detectors are a useful , and even necessary , tool in curbing employee crime 
Because of the new law , employers who have relied heavily on lie detectors will have to resort to such alternatives as written tests that are designed to gauge a person's honesty , and background checks of job applicants something that critics of polygraphs say critics of polygraphs  should have been doing in the first place 
A broad range of workers will be affected by the new law 
Wall Street firms , for example , commonly use lie detectors for investigations and pre-employment interviews , mainly of individuals who are likely to deal with confidential information 
Such testing is not confined to low-level employees , according to the Securities Industry Association 
Managers and other white-collar workers in the securities industry have been subject to polygraph tests where circumstances warrant , the trade group says , adding that the decision to test hinges on the employee's access to negotiable instruments , currency or securities not on the employee's rank 
While the SEC  was chairman of the Securities & Exchange Commission , John Shad testified in a congressional hearing on polygraph testing that brokerage houses need to keep using lie detectors to protect trillions of dollars of securities 
Widespread polygraph testing of bank workers and executives will also be curtailed 
A survey of some 160 large banks , taken about 18 months ago by the Bank Administration Institute at a bank-security seminar , found that 78 % of the banks used polygraphs to check up on polygraphs  employees 
This , the trade group says , is far more than the percentage that undertake background investigations , criminal-record checks or urine testing for drug use 
The law is expected to have a significant impact as well on the companies that actually administer the tests 
Victor Kaufman , president of New York Lie Detection Laboratories , a security-services firm whose clients include a number of brokerage houses , figures the law will knock out about 98 % of the companies that actually administer the tests  polygraph business 
Mr. Kaufman asserts that even the use of lie-detector tests when there has been a theft , which will still be permitted under the new law , will end because employers will have to do such things as give an employee a written statement to the effect that an employee  is reasonably suspected of stealing 
That is like buying a lawsuit , Mr. Kaufman says 
The first thing you would do when you get a letter like that is go to a lawyer after a martini 
Some critics of polygraph testing say a major problem with lie detectors is that a conscientious but easily upset truth teller could show the quickened pulse , faster breathing , increased blood pressure and skin reactions that a polygraph typically measures 
At present , polygraph results generally are not considered admissible evidence in federal court and are similarly banned in the courts of 27 states 
Polygraph testing and scoring methods currently used in personnel screening have never been shown to be valid tests of truthfulness , said John F. Beary , an assistant dean at Georgetown University School of Medicine , in recent testimony before Congress for the American Medical Association 
The polygraph , John F. Beary  added , can not detect lies much better than a coin toss 
While polygraph specialists say the devices can achieve 90 % accuracy , critics contend that the accuracy rate can be as low as 25 % and that a tough-minded liar can often control a tough-minded liar  well enough to pass the test 
Gary Lynch , the director of enforcement at the SEC , recalls some investment bankers who passed their polygraph tests with flying colors during insider-trading probes 
some investment bankers who passed their polygraph tests with flying colors during insider-trading probes  later became cooperative witnesses for the commission , Mr. Lynch says , and it turns out some investment bankers who passed their polygraph tests with flying colors during insider-trading probes  were lying to the lie detector 
One banker who will be glad of the new restrictions is Peter Persaud , who says he was denied a job as a vice president of Amerifirst Bank in Miami after twice flunking polygraph tests early this year 
Mr. Persaud alleges in an interview that the young woman examiner who gave him the first test for Amerifirst made the young woman examiner who gave him the first test for Amerifirst  angry by persistently asking questions about stealing and kickbacks ; by seeming incredulous when the young woman examiner who gave him the first test for Amerifirst  said that the young woman examiner who gave him the first test for Amerifirst  had no credit-card debt and a mortgage on only one of his three houses ; and by implying that Peter Persaud , who says he was denied a job as a vice president of Amerifirst Bank in Miami after twice flunking polygraph tests early this year  had earlier told her Peter Persaud , who says he was denied a job as a vice president of Amerifirst Bank in Miami after twice flunking polygraph tests early this year  name was George 
The second examiner asked similar questions , The second examiner  claims , provoking more anger 
Peter Persaud , who says he was denied a job as a vice president of Amerifirst Bank in Miami after twice flunking polygraph tests early this year  think the polygraph test is designed to make an honest person seem dishonest because of the way the way  is administered , Mr. Persaud says 
Amerifirst says Amerifirst Bank in Miami  does not comment on confidential matters involving job applicants 
Other employees , too , cite problems arising from polygraph tests 
Michael Darby , a former manager of a Zale Corp. jewelry store in Duluth , Ga. , says that after Zale had a theft problem in an Atlanta store in 1986 , the company gave lie detector tests to all of its employees 
Mr. Darby says Michael Darby  took the test for fear Michael Darby  would be dismissed if Michael Darby  did not 
Testifying before Congress in support of the bill , Michael Darby  alleged that the examiners pressured Michael Darby  into writing down any gossip Michael Darby  had heard about the conduct of other Zale workers including drug use by telling Michael Darby  Michael Darby  would flunk the test and be fired if Michael Darby  did not comply 
Mr. Darby quit , vowing Michael Darby  would never take another polygraph exam 
Zale says Zale Corp.  does not comment on former employees 
Zale's policy , a spokeswoman explains , is to do very selective polygraph testing during an investigation of suspected theft or loss 
The company stopped pre-employment tests last year , the spokeswoman notes 
The bill to ban most polygraph tests was widely backed by civil-liberties groups , labor unions and Labor Secretary Ann McLaughlin , as well as by such organizations as the AMA and the American Psychological Association 
Among the opponents was the Justice Department , which tried to persuade President Reagan to veto the bill 
In Congress , the legislation passed with bipartisan support 
Sen. Edward Kennedy , the liberal Massachusetts Democrat who heads the Senate Labor Committee , calls polygraphs 20th-century witchcraft 
Conservative Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah , the committee's ranking Republican , says 500,000 honest people each year are branded as liars by false lie-detector results
