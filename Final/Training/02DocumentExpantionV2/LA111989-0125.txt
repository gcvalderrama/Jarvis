In late 1985 , Shirley Lampel was a woman in anguish 
Shirley Lampel  husband had just died , and years of suffering from diabetes had left Shirley Lampel  without sight in one eye and only limited vision in the other 
The one ray of hope was financial 
Shirley Lampel  doting husband , Sy , an auto mechanic , had left a $ 30,000 life insurance policy 
Prudently invested , a $ 30,000 life insurance policy  would help support Shirley Lampel  modest but comfortable life in Santa Maria , Calif. 
But Lampel reckoned without Irvine-based Lincoln Savings & Loan and Arizona home builder Charles H. Keating Jr. , who had acquired the thrift the year before 
As a result of what Shirley Lampel  thought was a rock-solid investment with Lincoln , Shirley Lampel  savings were devoured in what was to become one of the great financial fiascoes of American history one that could eventually cost taxpayers about $ 2 billion 
Lincoln gives a whole new definition to bank robbery , a bitter Lampel said recently 
Lincoln  used to be that a person puts on a mask and goes in with a gun and robs a bank 
Now the taxpayers go into the bank and the taxpayers get mugged 
When did the bank become the crook ? 
That is not how Keating and his subordinates see a bank  
But what Keating and his subordinates  did was use Lincoln's millions of dollars in federally insured deposits as new money for his cash-hungry real estate and financial empire 
Shunning traditional home mortgages , Keating and his subordinates  channeled the S&L's funds into huge tracts of raw land in Arizona , luxurious hotel projects , a portfolio of junk bonds and other speculative ventures , according to federal regulators 
Now , federal and state investigators , regulators and lawmakers are poring over the details of Keating's activities 
Already , regulators have filed a civil racketeering lawsuit accusing Keating and other Lincoln executives of squandering $ 1.1 billion in federally insured deposits through a series of illegal , fraudulent and imprudent acts 
The suit and other documents allege that Keating and his associates sought to evade regulatory restrictions on such investments by making bogus loans to straw property buyers 
his associates  also devised a tax plan that let them divert $ 95 million to Lincoln's parent company by creating phantom profits through sham land swaps and loans , the regulators allege , and used accounting gimmicks , legal maneuvering and political string-pulling to further his associates  operations and slow down investigators 
The Senate Ethics Committee decided last week to appoint an outside counsel to investigate Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif )
and four other senators who accepted large campaign contributions from Keating and then intervened with regulators on his behalf 
Compounding the ultimate cost to others , Keating and Began as Lawyer Keating  associates sold about $ 200 million in now-worthless debt securities to unwary customers such as Mrs. Lampel at Lincoln's branch offices 
Many of the purchasers were elderly Southern Californians who thought the securities issued by Lincoln's parent company were federally insured 
Keating has repeatedly denied the government's charges 
Began as Lawyer Keating  has accused regulators of seeking revenge against Began as Lawyer Keating  , harassing Began as Lawyer Keating  employees and failing to understand real estate development 
That , not his own actions , drove Lincoln to ruin , Began as Lawyer Keating  says 
As a longtime home builder and mortgage lender , Began as Lawyer Keating  said , Began as Lawyer Keating  operation always has concentrated on single-family housing 
Began as Lawyer Keating  simply turned Lincoln , an institution whose financial health was questionable when Began as Lawyer Keating  bought Lincoln  , from a mortgage lender into a company that prepared raw land for residential construction , and Began as Lawyer Keating  had a number of projects successfully built , Began as Lawyer Keating  maintained 
Whatever the various government investigations ultimately disclose , it is already clear that Lincoln is one of the worst disasters in the nationwide savings and loan debacle 
Began as Lawyer Keating , a collegiate gold medal swimmer in the Pan American Games and a Navy fighter pilot in World War II , began Began as Lawyer Keating  business career as a lawyer in Cincinnati 
In a conservative business community that traced Began as Lawyer Keating , a collegiate gold medal swimmer in the Pan American Games and a Navy fighter pilot in World War II  antecedents to the days when the Ohio River was the key to settling the American heartland , Keating stood out as an aggressive risk-taker and a stubborn competitor 
Began as Lawyer Keating  was once described by Began as Lawyer Keating  brother , William , as an impatient person who never worried about the popularity of Began as Lawyer Keating  positions 
Also , Began as Lawyer Keating  showed an early taste for combining business with politics 
In the political arena , Began as Lawyer Keating  became a vociferous opponent of pornography , aiding prosecutions , lobbying elected officials 
Began as Lawyer Keating  was even appointed to a federal commission that studied pornography 
And Began as Lawyer Keating  managed Began as Lawyer Keating  brother's successful congressional campaigns in 1970 and 1972 
At the same time , Keating pursued a career in real estate development that eventually made Began as Lawyer Keating  a top executive in a firm owned by wealthy Cincinnati financier Carl H. Lindner , who specialized in making aggressive takeover bids for other companies 
The close association other companies  developed continued long after Keating left Cincinnati in 1976 to take over a foundering Lindner real estate development firm in Phoenix 
A few years after moving West , Keating had Began as Lawyer Keating  first serious brush with federal regulators 
In 1979 , Lindner and Keating consented to a Securities and Exchange Commission order prohibiting federal regulators  from fraudulently diverting corporate assets to federal regulators  personal use 
By the early 1980s , Keating riding the tide of explosive growth in the Sun Belt had built the former Lindner construction firm , renamed American Continental Corp. , into one of the nation's 10 biggest home builders 
Moreover , Keating riding the tide of explosive growth in the Sun Belt  like others had noticed a new opportunity : Congress , trying to rescue a savings and loan industry saddled with traditional low-rate , long-term home mortgage loans in an era of soaring interest rates , was dismantling the web of federal regulations that had always circumscribed the industry 
Under deregulation , banks and S&Ls were allowed to place a part of others  assets in direct investments such as ownership interests in real estate projects and other ventures , instead of just making loans on which others  would collect interest 
others  were also allowed to place customer funds in high-yield , high-risk junk bonds and other non-traditional investments 
Real estate developers saw the thrifts as ideal sources of cash for Real estate developers  own ventures 
Real estate developers  liked savings and loans better than banks because Real estate developers  had broader investment powers and were cheaper to acquire 
In addition , the rules required thrift owners to put up only $ 3 of thrift owners  own cash for every $ 100 in S&L investments 
The capital requirement for banks was twice as high : $ 6 for every $ 100 in assets 
California was an especially tempting target for such takeovers 
In an effort to prevent state-chartered savings and loans from converting to federal institutions , California had enacted an even more liberal deregulation law than the federal government 
In 1983 , the state allowed thrifts to put 100 % of their money into direct investments 
From his headquarters in Phoenix , Keating spotted a California thrift that seemed ideal for his expanding purposes 
Lincoln Savings & Loan was an Orange County thrift that had experienced losses in the early 1980s , but an Orange County thrift that had experienced losses in the early 1980s  had returned to profitability by the end of 1983 
Keating bought an Orange County thrift that had experienced losses in the early 1980s  in February , 1984 , for $ 51 million 
At the time , regulators say , federal regulators  were assured that Lincoln's previous management and lending policies would be retained 
Instead , Keating transformed the traditional mortgage lender into a post-deregulation dynamo 
Indeed , Began as Lawyer Keating  said Began as Lawyer Keating  bought Lincoln to take full advantage of California's deregulation law 
Keating ousted the old executives , turned away from the S&L's traditional areas of business and began seeking bigger profits from riskier strategies : Began as Lawyer Keating  used Lincoln's deposits to buy huge tracts of undeveloped Arizona desert in an effort to create shining new communities from dust 
The most ambitious of those projects was Estrella , a 20,000-acre planned community 20 miles southwest of Phoenix that was to include 50,000 homes for 200,000 residents as well as retail , industrial and office space 
Estrella  assembled parcels of land in the affluent Phoenix suburb of Scottsdale to build a $ 296-million luxury resort hotel called the Phoenician Resort 
Estrella  also bought the Hotel Pontchartrain , a troubled hotel in downtown Detroit , and initiated elaborate renovations 
Estrella  used Lincoln funds to buy junk bonds and dabble in foreign currency trading 
Estrella  bought big blocks of stock in other companies , prompting speculation that Estrella  might be a budding corporate raider 
Estrella  even sold the home-building unit of American Continental as Estrella  created a complex organization with 55 subsidiaries primarily devoted to real estate investment and development 
Efficacy in Doubt In Washington , meanwhile , some were beginning to question the efficacy of the government's prescription for the ailing thrift industry 
Edwin J. Gray , whose position as chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board made chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board  the nation's top savings and loan regulator , was one of them 
Across the country , S&Ls were using S&Ls  customersmoney to acquire stakes in windmill farms , restaurants and a host of other businesses S&Ls  knew little about 
Such investments , far from returning the industry to health , were bringing new losses so huge S&Ls  threatened the solvency of the federal deposit insurance fund 
Gray began speaking out 
What is more , Edwin J. Gray  proposed a rule to require all federally insured thrifts , including state-chartered S&Ls such as Lincoln , to limit direct investments to 10 % of state-chartered S&Ls such as Lincoln  assets 
Keating for one was furious 
As Keating for one  describes it , Keating for one  had barely gotten into the S&L game and already the rules were changing 
Arguing that Gray's proposed restriction would destroy the industry , Keating began lobbying hard against that Gray's proposed restriction  
Edwin J. Gray  hired Alan Greenspan , a respected economist who had served as a senior official in the Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford administrations and now heads the Federal Reserve Board , to analyze the proposed rule 
Greenspan produced a report opposing a report  
Although executives at other savings and loans also lobbied against the direct investment rule , Keating was perhaps the most prominent and persistent opponent 
Keating arranged for a congressional resolution that called on Gray to delay implementing the investment restriction for six months 
Although 225 House members signed the resolution , it failed to sway the regulators 
Unable to stop the restriction , Keating found a way to blunt the investment restriction  impact on Lincoln 
The Gray rule would be adopted in early 1985 , Keating learned , but would be applied retroactively to Dec. 10 , 1984 ; any direct investments made before that date would be permitted to stand , even if 225 House members  exceeded the 10 % limit 
Three days before the expected deadline , Lincoln won approval from the California Department of Savings and Loan to move an additional $ 800 million into direct investments 
That increased Lincoln's direct investments to about 40 % of Three days before the expected deadline  $ 2.2 billion in assets 
Customers Targeted In 1986 , Keating and his executives came up with an innovative way to raise unrestricted funds for American Continental : Customers Targeted In 1986 , Keating and his executives  would sell debt securities similar to the bonds issued by most of America's major corporations 
But , instead of selling Customers Targeted In 1986 , Keating and his executives  through Wall Street brokerages and other investment firms , Customers Targeted In 1986 , Keating and his executives  would peddle the securities to Lincoln customers 
The California Department of Corporations routinely approved American Continental's first request to sell the debt securities , called subordinated debentures 
About the same time , the state Department of Savings and Loan allowed American Continental to set up desks in the lobbies of Lincoln's 29 branches to sell the securities 
Although the securities were , in effect , junk bonds , Keating said Began as Lawyer Keating  would have recommended Customers Targeted In 1986 , Keating and his executives  to anyone , even to the Roman Catholic charities Began as Lawyer Keating  supported heavily with donations 
In fact , the Sisters of Charity in Cincinnati bought $ 444,000 of the securities 
In early 1988 , American Continental sought approval for a second debenture offering 
The California Department of Corporations approved the sales , even though the agency's own staff and the state's top savings and loan regulators expressed concern about the company's financial condition and ability to repay the debt 
In little more than two years , American Continental sold about $ 200 million worth of debt securities to nearly 22,000 investors 
About two-thirds of them were elderly Southern Californians who bought two-thirds of them  at Lincoln branch offices 
Some of them have said in lawsuits and congressional testimony that they were persuaded to buy the securities instead of certificates of deposit by American Continental sales representatives , who assured American Continental sales representatives  that the securities were safe 
Some have said they thought that the debentures were backed by federal deposit insurance a costly mistake , as things turned out 
Regulators Cool By 1986 , federal regulators in the regional office in San Francisco were becoming distinctly unsympathetic to Keating's operations 
Regulators Cool  began a detailed audit of Lincoln's books that stretched over a full year far longer than such examinations normally take 
Regulators Cool  concluded that Keating was handling Lincoln in an unsafe and unsound manner 
In particular , examiners reported that Lincoln had made a substantial number of loans without proper appraisals , without verification of borrowerscredit and even , in some cases , without a loan application 
To a large extent , the examiners said in the examiners  reports , a large extent  appeared that Lincoln was making bogus loans in an effort to get around the new restrictions on direct investments in real estate and to record profits that Lincoln  had not really earned 
Many major loans were made to straw buyers : people who bought properties with Lincoln funds on favorable terms and who never intended to repay the loans , thus leaving the savings and loan in control of the properties , the regulatory reports allege 
The examiners said that , after making the loans , Lincoln claimed as profits the up-front fees and interest such loans normally generate 
However , in many cases Lincoln had also provided the money for the fees and interest in addition to financing the entire purchase price 
In May , 1987 , the examiners recommended to the examiners  superiors in Washington that the government seize the institution or at least impose a restrictive order to curtail the government's  high-flying operations 
Lincoln executives defended other Lincoln executives of squandering $ 1.1 billion in federally insured deposits through a series of illegal , fraudulent and imprudent acts  practices , saying government regulators did not understand the S&L's development-oriented business 
Regulators insisted , for instance , on using standards that applied to single-family loans to evaluate Lincoln's commercial loans 
The thrift had obtained audited financial statements from the borrowers , and those documents provided a better picture of possible risks than a consumer credit report , the borrowers  said 
the borrowers  contended also that regulators made simple mathematical errors in computing such items as how much Lincoln should set aside in reserves to protect against possible losses 
The big loans were made to borrowers who came up with 25 % down payments , company executives said 
Lincoln did not finance 100 % of the purchase price , borrowers who came up with 25 % down payments  said , and any other loans that the buyers obtained were not for the purpose of providing the down payments 
Lincoln , borrowers who came up with 25 % down payments  said , was entitled to record the profits on the loans 
The recommendations of the regional regulators were not adopted by Gray or M. Danny Wall , who replaced Gray as head of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board in July , 1987 
Wall , a former staff aide to the Senate Banking Committee , said that there was insufficient evidence to justify the extreme action proposed by the San Francisco overseers 
If the rebuff angered the regional examiners , what came next stunned the regional examiners  
A year later , Wall stripped the regional examiners  of the regional examiners  supervisory responsibility for Lincoln and transferred jurisdiction to Washington 
Wall said an internal investigation had determined that substantial animosity had developed between Lincoln and the San Francisco regulators and that leaks of confidential financial information had damaged the savings and loan 
Wall ordered a new examination directed by Washington-based regulators 
Instead of absolving Lincoln , however , the new audit reached even more damaging conclusions 
Among other things , Lincoln  called into question the tax-sharing plan Lincoln and its accountants had devised in 1986 
As a subsidiary of American Continental , Lincoln did not deal directly with the Internal Revenue Service on taxes 
Instead , American Continental collected money from all American Continental  subsidiaries , then filed a consolidated tax return and made tax payments to the IRS on its accountants  behalf 
Over a period of a little more than two years , Lincoln made $ 95 million in tax-sharing payments to a period of a little more than two years  parent company , ostensibly to cover taxes on profits a period of a little more than two years  had earned 
But the government alleges in the government's  racketeering lawsuit and other documents that Lincoln did not owe $ 95 million in taxes at the time and that American Continental never paid any of that money to the IRS 
Keating and Began as Lawyer Keating  subordinates engaged in a series of sham transactions designed to create the appearance of higher profits , and thus higher tax obligations , as a device for siphoning money out of Lincoln and moving Lincoln  to American Continental , which kept the extra funds , according to federal investigators 
Higher profits also boosted American Continental's stock price 
That in turn helped Keating and his family collect $ 34 million over five years from salaries , gains on stock sales and other benefits , regulatory records state 
The stock sales were made to American Continental's employee stock ownership plan , which obtained loans guaranteed by Lincoln to acquire the shares 
Lincoln executives said other Lincoln executives of squandering $ 1.1 billion in federally insured deposits through a series of illegal , fraudulent and imprudent acts  did not misuse the tax-sharing arrangement 
The executives contend the transactions that generated the profits were legitimate and that Lincoln owed taxes , although other Lincoln executives of squandering $ 1.1 billion in federally insured deposits through a series of illegal , fraudulent and imprudent acts  acknowledged that the taxes might not have been due immediately 
And , although Lincoln owed the taxes as a separate entity , other Lincoln executives of squandering $ 1.1 billion in federally insured deposits through a series of illegal , fraudulent and imprudent acts  said , American Continental could use $ 250 million in tax credits Lincoln  had accumulated Lincoln  to offset any profits on a consolidated basis that Lincoln  or Lincoln  subsidiaries made 
Meantime , executives argued , the parent company could invest Lincoln's tax payments any way Lincoln's parent company  chose 
The tax plan was reviewed and approved by regulators , federal regulators  pointed out 
federal regulators  sold stock to the employee stock ownership plan , the executives said , because the plan , by American Continental's employee stock ownership plan  very nature , required the purchase of American Continental stock 
Because the stock was thinly traded , the plan could not acquire the big blocks of stock American Continental stock  needed except through sales by insiders 
the insiders  said also that the price the insiders received for the insiders  stock was slightly below prevailing market prices 
And any allegations of boosting stock prices to get money out of the employee stock ownership plan through the sales , the insiders  said , fall flat because most of such stock purchases occurred in 1985 , long before the allegedly fraudulent transactions occurred 
Example Cited One example of how Lincoln conducted Lincoln  business , according to government regulators , is a loan the S&L's development-oriented business  made to Ernest C. Garcia , a Phoenix-area developer 
Early in 1987 , Garcia approached Lincoln to see if Ernest C. Garcia  could borrow money to buy the remaining stock in a company in which Ernest C. Garcia  already held a 20 % interest 
Lincoln executives agreed to make the loan , regulators allege , but there was a condition 
According to the government's racketeering lawsuit , the following events occurred : As a condition of lending Ernest C. Garcia  the money Ernest C. Garcia  wanted , Lincoln asked Garcia to buy 1,000 acres of land owned by a Lincoln subsidiary for $ 14 million 
The 1,000 acres were part of an 8,500-acre tract called Hidden Valley Ranch 
Garcia told Lincoln that Ernest C. Garcia  could not make the purchase Ernest C. Garcia  , so Ernest C. Garcia  arranged for a firm called Westcontinental Mortgage & Investment Corp. to buy the 1,000 acres instead 
Lincoln agreed to the arrangement and lent Westcon $ 10.5 million , or 75 % of the purchase price 
At the same time , Lincoln lent Garcia $ 20.2 million , and Garcia lent $ 3.5 million of that amount to Westcon 
The $ 3.5 million was used by Westcon to make the 25 % cash down payment on the land purchase 
Lincoln recorded an $ 11-million profit on the transaction , even though the only cash it received was $ 3.5 million that had come out of the only cash it received  own coffers , the suit contends 
Westcon has never made a payment on Westcon  $ 10.5-million loan 
In a May , 1988 , letter , Westcon acknowledged that a May , 1988 , letter  had acted as Garcia's nominee and asked Garcia's nominee  to arrange for the transfer of this property to a May , 1988 , letter  rightful owner as soon as possible 
That transaction was the first of 10 involving Hidden Valley Ranch property 
The government alleges that , altogether , Lincoln claimed phantom profits of $ 82 million from the 10 deals 
Those profits resulted in Lincoln's making $ 31 million in tax-sharing payments to Lincoln  parent company 
American Continental executives rejected the government's characterization of the Hidden Valley loans 
American Continental executives  said that Garcia , for instance , obtained a $ 30-million line of credit and that the $ 20.2 million Ernest C. Garcia  borrowed on the line was wired directly to the Tucson Electric Power Co. , which owned 80 % of the company Garcia had founded in 1981 
The Hidden Valley deal , American Continental executives  said , was not a condition for obtaining the line of credit , and Garcia , a major developer , used Ernest C. Garcia  own funds to lend Westcon the down payment 
Senators Intervene It was during this period that one of the most controversial episodes in the Lincoln case occurred 
In Ernest C. Garcia  struggle against the regulators , Keating enlisted the aid of five U.S. senators , who intervened on Ernest C. Garcia  behalf in two now-controversial meetings with thrift regulators in April , 1987 
The five senators Cranston , Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz )
, John McCain (R-Ariz )
, John Glenn (D-Ohio )and Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich )
had received more than $ 300,000 in campaign contributions from Keating , John Glenn (D-Ohio ) family and John Glenn (D-Ohio ) business associates 
In addition , Cranston solicited $ 850,000 from Keating for three voter registration groups that signed up primarily Democrats 
Glenn solicited $ 200,000 for a political organization John Glenn (D-Ohio ) controlled 
And McCain's wife and McCain's wife  father invested nearly $ 360,000 in a 1986 Keating partnership that put up a Phoenix shopping center 
The first meeting , on April 2 , 1987 , involved bank board Chairman Gray and Sens. DeConcini , Glenn , McCain and Cranston 
Gray later stated publicly that the four senators tried to make a deal for Keating by promising to get Lincoln to make more traditional home mortgages again if Gray would rescind the 10 % limit on Lincoln's direct investments 
four other senators who accepted large campaign contributions from Keating and then  effort , Gray declared , was an abuse of senatorial authority and tantamount to an attempt to subvert the regulatory process 
The senators heatedly deny proposing any such deal 
four other senators who accepted large campaign contributions from Keating and then  say four other senators who accepted large campaign contributions from Keating and then  met with Gray to discuss the unusually lengthy audit of Lincoln by the San Francisco regional office ; four other senators who accepted large campaign contributions from Keating and then  only message , the four senators say , was that the regulators should charge Keating with something or get off Keating with something  back 
The second meeting occurred a week later 
Riegle joined the other four in a session with regional regulators who were conducting the protracted examination of Lincoln 
Minutes of the meeting show that DeConcini mentioned the direct investment rule , but there was no subsequent discussion of the issue 
The minutes indicate also that the session ended abruptly when the regulators said federal regulators  intended to refer the Lincoln case to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution 
That investigation is now under way 
Regardless of whether a deal over the 10 % rule was ever discussed , critics of the senatorsactions suggest that critics of the senatorsactions  involvement may have delayed the ultimate seizure of Lincoln by two years , adding at least $ 1 billion to the taxpayersbill for bailing out the thrift 
Last Thursday , the Senate Ethics Committee decided to appoint an outside counsel to investigate whether the five senators violated ethics rules by going to bat for Keating 
Cranston , meanwhile , filed a formal response to the committee contending that Cranston , Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz ) had done nothing illegal or improper in connection with Keating 
Cranston , Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz ) said Cranston , Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz ) efforts on Lincoln's behalf never went beyond what a member of Congress can legally do for a constituent who is experiencing problems with the government 
Cranston denied that Cranston , Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz ) actions were in any way responsible for the losses facing the government or the people who bought the American Continental debt securities 
Bright Projections And what of Keating's enormous bets on the future of Arizona real estate ? 
In brochures for Estrella , Estrella  big planned community southwest of Phoenix , Keating boasted that Phoenix would soon become the 12th-largest metropolitan area in the country 
Employment was rising at an annual rate of nearly 4 % as new residents flocked to the Grand Canyon state , and the future seemed as bright as the desert sun 
A Lincoln subsidiary put in miles of sidewalks , created two lakes and made other improvements at Estrella 
Some businesses began to move in 
Meanwhile , Keating poured a total of $ 296 million into the Phoenician Resort in Scottsdale , which was designed to attract the affluent tourists who had been streaming into the state in increasing numbers every winter 
Then things went bad 
The influx of new residents and businesses to Arizona began to slow , but developers kept right on developing 
Before long , the state was vastly overbuilt 
The residential real estate market went flat 
The commercial market fell through the floor 
Even the tourist trade dropped off 
Today , Estrella bears little resemblance to Keating's predictions ; much of the land is still largely undeveloped 
The Phoenician opened in late 1988 , and , although it is generating tremendous income $ 4.3 million last month alone it is not generating enough to pay off its construction debt , regulators claim 
Lincoln never was a viable institution under Keating , said Bert Ely , an Alexandria , Va.-based consultant to the savings and loan industry 
Last week , government regulators seized control of the Phoenician and another Lincoln property , the Crescent Hotel in Phoenix , ousting Keating and as many as 30 of Began as Lawyer Keating  associates from management of the lodges 
Seizure Occurs The government finally seized Lincoln on April 14 , 1989 , declaring that the government's  was being operated in an unsafe and unsound manner and that Keating and Began as Lawyer Keating  executives were dissipating the government's  assets 
The day before Lincoln was seized , American Continental filed for protection from creditors in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Phoenix 
The bankruptcy case prevented regulators from assuming full control of some of Lincoln's assets 
Also , The bankruptcy case  created an unusual group of victims 
Lincoln's regular depositors would be made whole by taxpayers through the federal deposit insurance program , but the 22,000 investors who had bought the American Continental debt securities were left holding worthless paper 
There was no federal insurance for Lincoln's regular depositors  
One of those investors was Shirley Lampel 
In 1985 , Lampel's husband had died of a heart attack at the age of 58 
Despite Shirley Lampel  inability to work because of the diabetes that had left Shirley Lampel  all but blind , Lampel sought no pity 
With Social Security payments and the monthly income from her husband's $ 30,000 life insurance proceeds , Shirley Lampel  would make Social Security  
One day , after moving from Santa Maria to Tustin , Shirley Lampel  had noticed a large newspaper advertisement about an investment opportunity being offered at a Lincoln office near Shirley Lampel  condominium 
Shirley Lampel  took Shirley Lampel  life insurance proceeds and practically beat down the door at the Lincoln branch to buy American Continental debt securities 
After being assured that Lincoln was safe and sound , Shirley Lampel  had signed two pieces of paper and handed over a $ 30,000 cashier's check 
Shirley Lampel  could not read the fine print , and Shirley Lampel  said no one ever read the documents to Shirley Lampel  
Shirley Lampel  thought Shirley Lampel  was buying something similar to a certificate of deposit , Shirley Lampel  said 
Shirley Lampel  did not know what debentures were 
You have home insurance and car insurance , but do most of us really understand all that stuff ? 
No
