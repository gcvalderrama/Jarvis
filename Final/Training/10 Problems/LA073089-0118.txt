The National Rifle Association is battling against those who would
enact state or federal gun control legislation, using direct mail to
raise depleted funds and urge members to contact legislators.

The NRA suffered a series of setbacks in the past three years as
Congress and state legislatures enacted bans on "cop killer bullets,"
Saturday Night Specials and plastic guns that elude metal detectors.
Well publicized shootings of children in school settings have fueled
this activity.

Various states have passed gun control acts and prominent law
enforcement officials and politicians, such as U.S. Senator Dennis
DeConcini have ceased supporting the NRA cause.
