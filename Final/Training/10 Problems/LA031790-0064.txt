In a solemn ceremony held Friday in Lafayette Park, located across the
street from the White House, family, friends and colleagues of Terry
A. Anderson gathered to mark the fifth anniversary of the AP
Correspondent's capture by Islamic fundamentalists in Beirut.

The gathering brought together the families of seven other Americans
who were kidnapped after Anderson and are still held in the Lebanon
capital.  There were songs, prayers and remembrances during the event.

There was no evidence that the hostages would be released any time
soon despite an announcement two weeks earlier by Iranian President
Hashemi Rafsanjani who said he saw the hostage ordeal "moving toward a
solution."
