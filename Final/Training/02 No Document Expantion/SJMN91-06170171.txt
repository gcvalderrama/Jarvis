The Mount Pinatubo volcano was slowly rousing from 600 years of sleep. ; Two months ago, when the drama began, scientists knew almost nothing about this drowsy Philippine giant, swaddled in thick jungle and ignored by the hundreds of thousands of people living around its flanks. ; They did n't know it had a habit of exploding with a force twice as great as the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington -- or that the debris from these eruptions had covered much of what was now Clark Air Base. ; But with the first small signs of trouble, researchers went on alert, throwing a network of instruments around the restless mountain 
And in a few frenzied weeks of investigation, they learned enough to recommend evacuation of some 84,000 people. ; The warning came just in time 
A series of violent eruptions has rocked the mountain since Wednesday, blowing ash and pumice 80,000 feet in the air and sifting volcanic grit over villages 90 miles away 
At least 101 people have been killed, 150,000 Filipinos have crowded into refugee centers in Manila and 20,000 American military dependents and civilian workers are being evacuated from the country 
U.S. officials said the damage may lead them to permanently close Clark Air Base. ; On Monday, scientists said much of the pressure inside the volcano had dissipated and the worst may be over. ; Although Pinatubo never erupted into the cataclysmic blow-up that some had feared, the damage and death toll from related earthquakes, mudslides and falling ash and pumice could have been far higher had scientists not recommended evacuation 
The successful forecast points up just how far the science of volcanoes has come in the past decade. ; The basics are the same 
Researchers still use seismometers and other instruments to measure the trembling, quaking and bulging of the ground that often spell danger. ; But the technology has improved immensely : ; (check )Instruments are cheaper and more expendable, so they can be deployed where they will do the most good -- right in the path of the volcano's fury. ; (check )The instruments continually beam data to scientists who are waiting a safe distance away 
Before, they had to visit their instruments and collect the data by hand. ; (check )Information is routinely analyzed by computer, allowing researchers to assess a situation quickly -- and to develop computer models for predicting the behavior of volcanoes. ; Researchers have also made strides in interpreting what they see 
" Our biggest improvement has been in our own heads, " said Peter Lipman, a volcanologist with the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park. ; These skills were honed in a series of volcanic disasters that rocked the world over the past decade. ; " The 1980s was a very interesting decade because of the number of eruptions that have occurred for which we have good monitoring information, " said Steven Brantley, a geologist with the survey's Cascades Volcano Observatory in Vancouver, Wash. " It was a rather remarkable decade, really . 
; Scientists say the eruption of Mount St. Helens, which killed 57 people and caused $ 1 billion in property damage, triggered a renaissance in volcano research. ; It alerted the American public to volcano hazards and prompted a tenfold increase in government spending for volcano research and monitoring, said geologist Robert Tilling of USGS in Menlo Park. ; As a result, the survey opened two new volcano observatories 
One, in Washington, keeps track of active volcanoes in the Cascades Range of the Pacific Northwest and Northern California, including Mount St. Helens, Mount Rainier, Mount Hood, Mount Baker, Mount Shasta and Mount Lassen 
The second is in Alaska, where Redoubt Volcano put on a spectacular show in 1989 and 1990 
A third observatory has been operating in Hawaii since 1912. ; American scientists have since responded to a number of volcanic awakenings throughout the world, from Galunggung in Indonesia to Nevado del Ruiz in Colombia, improving their ability to quickly evaluate volcano hazards 
Such a quick response is crucial because only a few dozen of the world's 500 active volcanoes have been adequately investigated and monitored. ; " Now, " Tilling said, " we can go in there and literally overnight set up a seismic network, and start getting data within a day or two . 
; The blossoming research has in turn spurred development of cheaper and more rugged instruments. ; Take tiltmeters. ; Like glorified carpenters ' levels, they are used to measure the bulging and tilting of the ground as magma muscles its way toward the surface. ; A decade ago they cost thousands of dollars each 
But after Mount St. Helens blew, scientists looked for cheaper models 
One was developed by James Westphal, a well-known astronomer and gadgeteer at the California Institute of Technology, who patterned it after an idea used in missile guidance systems 
Now tiltmeters are inexpensive enough to place in areas likely to get wiped out in eruptions. ; The humble seismometer has also grown more useful as scientists learn to better interpret what it's saying. ; " Volcanoes are probably the most complex structures you can find on this planet, " said Bernard Chouet, a seismologist at the USGS in Menlo Park. ; It's not unusual for them to produce thousands of small earthquakes -- but those quakes can have a variety of causes 
Most are innocuous, caused by the cracking of rock above pools of magma that, for the moment, are n't going anywhere 
But others are ominous, reflecting the surge of magma toward the surface in preparation for an eruption. ; In the past few years, Chouet said, seismologists have learned to recognize distinctive tremors that mean an eruption is on its way 
These patterns were successfully used to forecast the 1989 eruption of Redoubt Volcano in Alaska, as well as the current eruptions at Pinatubo. ; But even though volcano warnings have proved far more accurate than earthquake forecasts, they 're far from foolproof. ; Some volcanoes give virtually no warning 
Even when they do, the decision to evacuate is difficult and expensive 
In the Philippines, for instance, vandals looted parts of Clark Air Base that were left unguarded 
Factories and businesses shut down ; crops and livestock were left unattended. ; This time the evacuation paid off, possibly averting a number of deaths 
But it wo n't always 
In the end, every volcano is a rugged individualist, with its own distinct patterns of activity 
Some wake up, make threatening noises for weeks or months, then drift back to sleep. ; The burden of deciding whether to warn the public weighs heavily on scientists. ; Randall White, another seismologist with the USGS in Menlo Park, recalled how he felt while working near the freezing summit of Colombia's Nevado del Ruiz six years ago. ; Struggling to hear their instruments above the noise of nearby broadcast towers, he and his colleagues warned local officials that an eruption was on its way 
But their warnings were vain 
For reasons that are still unclear, the officials did not order an evacuation, and 22,000 people died after lava spewed from the volcano, melting glaciers and forming devastating mudslides. ; " I found it nerve-racking, " White said 
" We were literally afraid to go to sleep at night, thinking that some technician would get the interpretation (of the incoming data )wrong, and a lot of people would die . 
; Tools give clues that can save lives ; The basic tools of volcano monitoring are cheaper and more portable than they were 10 years ago 
Scientists can move in fast and set up instruments that continually broadcast readings, which are then analyzed by computer 
This allows quicker evaluation of volcano hazards -- and forecasts that can save lives. ; 1 
Surveying : Researchers measure the volcano, with optical instruments or high-tech laser tools, to see if it is bulging or stretching as a result of magma rising inside 
They also put tiltmeters near the volcano's vent to record changes in the slope of the ground. ; 2 
Pick and shovel : Geologists dig through layers of old ash and lava to determine how often a volcano erupted in the past -- a clue to what it might do in the future 
The thicker and more extensive the deposit, the bigger the eruption. ; 3 
Seismometer : Measures ground shaking 
Volcanoes often produce swarms of small earthquakes 
Researchers are learning to distinguish ordinary earthquakes from those caused by magma rising toward the surface -- a sign of impending eruption. ; 4 
Spectrometer : First developed to measure pollutants from factory smokestacks, it is now also used to measure sulfur dioxide in the smoke belched by volcanoes 
Increasing levels of the gas may signal an impending eruption 
The amount of gas reflects the amount of magma beneath the volcano, and thus the potential size of the eruption. ; Sources : Robert Tilling and Steven Brantley, U.S. Geological Survey : " The Earth, " by Peter J.
