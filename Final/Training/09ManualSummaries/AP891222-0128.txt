Last week the Massachusetts Supreme Court banned lie detector tests
from use in criminal trials. Massachusetts had been one of the last
states that allowed defendants to use polygraph results to support an
alibi. Many states allow polygraph evidence if the prosecution and the
defense so agree. The Massachusetts court said that experts agreed
that there was a concern as to their accuracy, and cited studies that
showed accuracy rates varying from 50 to 95 percent. Last year a
federal law severely restricted the use of polygraphs in the private
sector. Companies that make the polygraph instruments were hit hard by
that law.
