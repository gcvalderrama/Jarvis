A team of experts, led by Admiral Fogarty, left the Persian Gulf after
a three-week investigation into the action of the USS Vincennes in
shooting down an Iranian airliner.  The team took sworn testimony from
the Vincennes and two other warships in the area, and complied data
from the computer tapes on the three vessels.  Navy officials provided
no details on the report and said that it might not be released until
mid-August.  Another team, this from the International Civil Air
Organization, is expected to arrive in Teheran on Friday to pursue its
own investigation of the incident.
