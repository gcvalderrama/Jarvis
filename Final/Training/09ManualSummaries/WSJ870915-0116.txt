Legal resumes get no better than Judge Bork's.  During his career, he
has inquired boldly into the nature of law and society.  None of the
416 opinions he has written or joined has been overturned by the
Supreme Court.  Nevertheless, he has been subjected to a fury centered
on the canard that he outside the legal mainstream.  Why?  Because the
once conventional doctrine of legal restraint is believed threatened
by the elites of law schools, bar associations and judiciary who enjoy
the power of activism.  Liberals want to defend their ability to
accomplish in court what the electorate is unwilling to enact.
