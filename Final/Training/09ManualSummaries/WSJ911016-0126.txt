The real battle over the confirmation of Clarence Thomas was joined
four years ago with the nomination of Robert Bork, but the roots of
the struggle go back even farther to the election of Ronald Reagan as
president in 1980. The voters gave Reagan a mandate but the losers
overturned the results of the election by engineering Bork's
rejection. This time Washington's reporters tried to arrange a
national referendum on sexual harassment thinking this would defeat
Thomas. But by every measure available the public gave Thomas
landslide support and Thomas is the first Justice to sit on the
Supreme Court with a popular mandate.
