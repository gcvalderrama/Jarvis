General Colin Powell was nominated Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff Thursday by President Bush.  He is expected to win easy Senate
confirmation and make history as the first black and the youngest ever
officer to hold the post.  Powell fits the mold of Bush's national
security advisers, like-minded pragmatists favoring consensus building
rather than confrontation.  He is considered fair in presenting others
viewpoints and fits a role where diplomacy and political finesse with
Congress is as essential as battlefield instincts.  He was credited
with helping the Reagan White House recover from the Iran- Contra
Affair and with guiding preparations for summits with Gorbachev.
