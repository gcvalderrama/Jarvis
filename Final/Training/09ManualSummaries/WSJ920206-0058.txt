In 1969 it appeared Bill Clinton would be drafted.  Studying at Oxford
wouldn't help; such deferments had ended in 1966.

The draft board in Arkansas was proud of him and had deferred him to 
go to Oxford, saying he'd be safe till fall, 1969.	
	 
As an out, he agreed in 1969 to join the ROTC at the University of
Arkansas.  He never enrolled, but it protected him during September
and October of 1969.  By October he subjected himself to the draft
lottery knowing that he was unlikely to be called.  He drew 311--and
was safe from induction.
