The Exxon Valdez was freed Wednesday.  Cleanup crews continue to skim
oil from the Prince William Sound.  The governor of Alaska, writing
that Exxon has been unresponsive, has asked the Coast Guard to take
over the clean-up efforts.  Earlier a team from Washington had
determined that federal management was not necessary.  An Exxon
spokesman maintained that Exxon was the best organization to manage
the cleanup.  Joseph Hazelwood, the fired tanker captain, has
surrendered and bail was set at $1 million bond.  Hazelwood, charged
with misdemeanors, has a history of drinking problems.  The FBI is
investigating bringing felony charges.  The Alaskan pipeline flow
returned to normal Wednesday and Exxon continues to search for a dry
dock.
