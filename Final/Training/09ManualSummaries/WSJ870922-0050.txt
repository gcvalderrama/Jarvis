During a period when no increases were made to the minimum wage as
well as a period when increases were made, US employment rose.
Conservatives and business groups see this as an argument against
raising the wage which they believe will cause a loss of jobs.  A
University of Pennsylvania economist says that estimates of dire
consequences for the economy by raising the minimum wage don't stand
up to scrutiny.  US Chamber of Commerce members say they would trim
employment or delay hiring if the wage is increased.  Working at
minimum wage no longer keeps workers above the poverty level.
