An Office of Thrift Supervision judge ruled on December 18, 1990 that
President Bush's son Neil violated conflict-of-interest regulations in
the failure of Silverado S&L, of which he was a director. He
recommended that if Bush takes a position at a financial institution
in the future, he be required to obtain a lawyer's advice on potential
conflicts, make a full disclosure of his business deals annually, and
abstain from voting on issues where he has an interest. Bush contested
the allegations. If the ruling is upheld, he intends to take the
matter to federal appeals court.
