An explosion Thursday in a 12-unit, three-story Ottawa apartment
building in a fashionable renovated area less than a mile from the
Canadian Parliament killed a man and injured three people. Rubble,
including concrete chunks the size of TVs, was sent flying as much as
a full block away and damaged cars and nearby downtown buildings.
Police believe the cause was either natural gas or propane. Witnesses
smelled gas immediately after the 9:30 AM blast. Two hours after the
blast, firefighters rescued a middle-aged woman trapped inside her
apartment. A dog brought in by police searched for other possible
victims.
