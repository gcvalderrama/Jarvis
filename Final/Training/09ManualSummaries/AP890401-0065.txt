The oil tanker Exxon Valdez, carrying 1.26 million barrels of
north-slope crude oil, grounded on a reef in Alaska's Prince William
Sound at 12:04am local time on March 24.  At 12:28 the Valdez reported
150,000 barrels released.  Two minutes later the Coast Guard closed
Port Valdez.  The ship remained on the reef through high tide and a
one-half mile oil slick was reported at 2:27am.  Coast Guard personnel
boarded the ship and reported 138,000 barrels lost.  At 4:14 the Exxon
Baton Rouge was sent to begin taking the remaining oil off of the
Valdez.
