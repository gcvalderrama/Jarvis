A motorist, Rodney King, was stopped in Los Angeles after speeding on
a freeway and then running several red lights.

Witnesses said he only left his car after several requests, then was
beaten as he attempted to rise from the ground where officers had
placed him.  The officers then reportedly beat him with night sticks
as they held him down.

The incident was witnessed by three bystanders.  A nearby apartment
resident videotaped the entire incident and the tape was broadcast by
local and national television, stirring public outrage.

Los Angeles County and the FBI have opened investigations into the
matter.
