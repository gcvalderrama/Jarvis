Governor Patten has woven politics into the lives of the people of
Hong Kong. Though he was opposed, the Chinese paid politically for
that opposition.  Patten has modified his position and replaced
functional groups with statutory bodies and a four group electoral
committee and scaled back his demand for an electorate of 2.7 million
to one million.  Britain and China reopened negotiations under public
pressure.  His approach is Western; the Chinese see the superiority of
an all-powerful government.  He has emphasized cooperation on
administrative and environmental matters.  China wants Hong Kong
compliance with its orders.  Patten said that when Hong Kong made
decisions, things went well, but if consultation with China was
necessary, nothing worked.
