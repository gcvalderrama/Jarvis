Controversy over the Clintons' unsuccessful Whitewater venture and the
failure of the Madison Savings and Loan goes on.  At the root of the
problem is whether the Clintons' failing investment was propped up by
Madison and whether Clinton, as governor, delayed shutting down
Madison so that could be done.  The Madison failure cost citizens 50
million dollars.

Whitewater files were handled by Vince Foster, who committed suicide
last year.

Neither Clinton nor Janet Reno have yet asked for a Special Counsel to
investigate Whitewater, although pressure to do so is building.
