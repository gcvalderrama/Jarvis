Robert Bork has written a book "The Tempting of America" to be
published by the Free Press.  In it he discusses his views of
democracy, legal theory and his contentious defeat as nominee to the
Supreme Court.  He claims that by politicizing the courts, Americans
have eaten away at "the peoples right to legislate the laws we want to
live by."  This undermines our constitutional separation of powers.
It is not just liberals; conservatives have done the same thing.  Both
are wrong.  He blames law school professors and other elite groups who
no longer trust the American people to decide our laws.
