House Minority Leader Michel said that the President would show no
flexibility on his position on the minimum wage.  Senator Kennedy,
whose Senate bill calls for a higher wage than the House, said that he
would offer an amendment to make his bill identical to that of the
House.  A new poll showed strong backing for the increased wage even
it triggered higher consumer prices, but fewer favored it if it meant
loss of jobs.  Bush has proposed increases leading to a rate of $4.25
by 1992, if employers could hire new workers at a sub-minimum wage for
six months.  The House bill would raise the wage to $4.55
