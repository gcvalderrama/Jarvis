Opponents of the nomination of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court
maintain that the nominee should be required to answer specific
questions about his personal and philosophical beliefs. Yet the
justice whom the nominee would replace took a firm stand against
answering just such questions at his hearings in 1967. Thurgood
Marshall said "A judge is not permitted to use his own personal views
under any circumstances." At those hearings Senator Edward Kennedy
stressed a central point both in the committee room and before the
full Senate: The Senate is to assess qualifications; it is not to
examine political or judicial philosophy.
