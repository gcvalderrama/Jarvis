Rodney King suffered a broken jaw, broken leg and numerous bruises as
he was released from the hospital in a wheelchair.

Meanwhile, a public furor erupted over the incident in which several
policemen beat him as he lay on the ground after a traffic stop.  The
entire incident was videotaped by a nearby resident who then took it
to a local TV station which passed it on to cable news and 30 million
home viewers.

Police officials, FBI and the District Attorney are investigating.

An ACLU spokesman said that the incident was not surprising, that "it
happens all the time."  Mr. King is black.
