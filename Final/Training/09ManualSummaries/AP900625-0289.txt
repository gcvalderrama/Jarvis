Southern Natural Gas has agreed to pay ARCO Oil and Gas more than $300
million for damages resulting from an explosion March 19, 1989 on an
ARCO drilling platform in the Gulf of Mexico. The blast and resulting
fire occurred when subcontractors hired by SNG tried to make repairs
and cut into the pipeline that transported gas to shore. Seven people
were killed and 23 injured, and the platform was destroyed. SNG, which
bought gas from ARCO, made no admission of guilt but agreed to pay
$300.5 million and a total of $500,000 to three ARCO employees injured
in the blast.
