After the controversy two months ago over White House Chief of Staff
John Sununu's use of government aircraft for private travel, President
Bush instituted new travel rules forbidding the practice. Now Sununu
has again created what the President calls an "appearance problem" by
using a government limousine to travel to New York on strictly
personal business. Replying to critics of the New York trip, Sununu
vowed he would not take advice from "self- styled experts" on how he
travels and explained that he took the car so as to be able to
communicate instantly with the White House in the interest of national
security.
