The United States has been asked by the ousted Kuwaiti government to
enforce the total trade embargo imposed by the United Nations on Iraq.
The White House said it would do "whatever is necessary".  Saddam
Hussein, to launch negotiations and to rally Arab support, announced
that he would withdraw his troops from Kuwait only if Israel withdraws
from occupied Arab lands.  The U.S. believes that a trade blockade
will eventually force Iraq into withdrawing from Kuwait or into
lashing out elsewhere.  The unpredictability of Iraqi's leader is a
principal reason why the U.S. is building such a mammoth force in the
region.
