During 1985-86, Charles Keating, his family and associates contributed
$350,000 to state politics. The contributions went to both Republican
and Democratic campaign funds.

Although a staunch conservative Republican, Keating's contributions
belie his political beliefs. Records show that his contributions, as
well as those of his family, friends and associates, were directed at
candidates and officials of state and federal offices who he later
called upon for assistance in his legal difficulties with state and
federal savings and loan regulators.

Neither was Keating hesitant in involving members of his family in his
illegal schemes. These included his son and three sons-in-law.
