Professor Anita Hill, who accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment
and so testified during the confirmation hearings, took a lie detector
test Sunday. Because her testimony had been challenged, she asked for
a polygraph test and according to the man who administered the tests,
she answered all questions honestly. The Chairman of the Committee
refused to allow the polygraph results to be placed into the record,
saying that courts do not accept polygraph evidence and that the
testing was done outside committee control. The man who gave the test
was a recognized expert but on an earlier occasion he had been accused
of improperly administering a test.
