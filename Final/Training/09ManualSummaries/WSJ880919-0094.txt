Vice President Bush has called for a boost in the wage floor thus
improving chances for enactment.  Bush, a presidential candidate,
voiced support after being jeered by workers who had suffered pay
cuts.  A Chamber of Commerce spokesman says that chances for passage
have now increased from "next to zero" to 50-50.  President Reagan who
had characterized minimum wage increases as causing unemployment says
he and Bush are in agreement.  A proposal by Senator Hatch to allow
employers to pay a "training wage" of 80% of the minimum may be a
stumbling block.  Proponents say that the increase is needed to raise
the income of millions of workers above the poverty line.
