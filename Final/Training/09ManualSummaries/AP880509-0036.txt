A strong earthquake that measured 5.2 on the Richter Scale rocked the
northern Japanese Island of Kokkaido at about at about 7:45 local time
today. Three hours earlier a quake of similar strength off the
Philippine Island of Luzon was felt in Manila. Every increase of one
integer on the scale represents a tenfold increase in strength, thus a
quake measuring 5.2 is ten times stronger than one of 4.2. Today's
quakes caused little damage because they occurred far below the
earth's surface. The last quake to cause great destruction in Hokkaido
occurred in 1968. It measure 7.9 and claimed 52 lives.
