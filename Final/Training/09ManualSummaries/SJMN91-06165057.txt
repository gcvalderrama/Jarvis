Boris Yeltsin, the radical populist who campaigned for transformation
of the Soviet economy on the principles of free enterprise, may have
won a solid victory Wednesday as the first elected president of
Russia.  He appeared certain of the absolute majority of more than 50
percent needed on the first ballot, avoiding a runoff.  A Yeltsin
victory would represent a distinct threat to Gorbachev, who never
faced a popular election.  Yeltsin could claim that he alone has a
democratic mandate to speak for the people of the Soviet Union's
largest republic.  Preliminary reports from widely diverse
constituencies indicate an impressive victory.
