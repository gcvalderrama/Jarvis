A strong earthquake centered in Soviet Azerbaijan shook the Caspian
Sea region early Sunday. One report said the quake measured 6.5 on the
Richter Scale, and another said 5.6. Teheran and other cities in
northern Iran were jolted. There was no word on casualties. It was the
third temblor in that region in the last five days. Iran is shaken by
hundreds of earthquakes every year that measure from 2.5 to 5.5 on the
Richter Scale and most do little damage. The last major quake in Iran
happened in September 1978. It measured 7.7 and caused 25,000 deaths.
