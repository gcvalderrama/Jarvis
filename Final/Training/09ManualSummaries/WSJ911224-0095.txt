A pioneer in cryobiology--the study of extremely low temperatures on
living things, learned in Antarctica that certain fish produce an
antifreeze molecule that lowers their freezing point enough to survive
Antarctic waters.  Glaciologists are testing to see whether the ice
sheet there is beginning to collapse.  If so, they warn, a world
cataclysmic cycle may be underway.  And last, because Antarctica is
one of the driest places on earth, thus enabling some telescopes to
better see cosmic radiation, this is one of the best places on earth
to study that key to one of the central paradoxes of cosmology.
