John Sununu, President Bush's chief of staff, is a combative,
conservative Republican. Although his brusque style rubs some people
the wrong way the brainy former New Hampshire governor is now given
credit for acting as a detached broker in policy debates. This
represents a striking change from the administration's opening months
when many wondered if the chief of staff would survive. Many political
analysts believe Sununu has moderated his brash style, but he insists
that it is Washington that has changed. Nevertheless, some Democrats
and Republicans alike believe that Sununu with his combative style may
still be accumulating too many enemies for his own good.
