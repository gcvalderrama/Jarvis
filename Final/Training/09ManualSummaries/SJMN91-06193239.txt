The "eclipse of the millennium" occurred this morning.  More than 40
million people saw the moon obscure the sun along a 160-mile-wide
swath from Hawaii to Mexico to Colombia. Clouds diminished the view
for many.  The total eclipse lasted more than six minutes.  Another to
last as long will not occur for 160 years.  Many devices were used to
allow watchers to follow the moon's path and see sunspots.  In Hawaii,
entrepreneurs sold almost all-imaginable souvenirs of the event, while
one church offered a nightly eclipse service.  Guatemalan Indian
villagers rang bells and banged pots and pans.
