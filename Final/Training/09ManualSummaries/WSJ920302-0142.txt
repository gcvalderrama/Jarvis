The seven-months Trans-Antarctica Expedition in 1989-1990 of Mr. Will
Steger by ski and dogsled with five others is documented in his book
"Crossing Antarctica" (Knopf, 104 pages, #25).  Crossing by the
longest possible route, it tells of the pride, resilience,
determination and diverse skills and personalities of the men
involved.  A Chinese, Japanese, Frenchman and Brit accompanied Steger,
an American.  The hardships they encountered were tremendous, but
familiar polar fare.  As polar literature, however, it does not reach
the technical fascination or tragic drama of the published accounts of
Amundsen's and Scott's adventures.  The photographs also are good, but
not breathtaking.
