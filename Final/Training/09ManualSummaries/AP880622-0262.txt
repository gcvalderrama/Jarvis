Safety standards may not be stringent enough in the cruise industry,
the chairman of a federal agency investigating the March engine-room
fire aboard the Scandinavian Star said Wednesday.

A crew member discovered the March 15 fire aboard the Star, carrying
439 mostly American passengers, as the ship returned form Cozumel,
Mexico to Tampa.

Smoke detectors and automatic systems to douse the fire failed.  Also,
the ship's emergency generators didn't work for an hour.

The Safety board will examine whether existing Coast Guard procedures
and international regulations are adequate to protect passengers or
whether more rigorous standards are needed.
