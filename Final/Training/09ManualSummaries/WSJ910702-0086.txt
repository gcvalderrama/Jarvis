President Bush's nomination of conservative black federal judge
Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court invites a vigorous fight in the
Senate. Although Thomas is smart, tough and speaks powerfully about
overcoming racism and poverty in the deep south, his strong opposition
to affirmative action raises questions with liberals. Thomas regards
affirmative action as patronizing and an ineffective remedy for
discrimination. Although Thomas has not committed himself on the issue
of abortion, abortion-rights groups are likely to be concerned about
the fact that Thomas is Catholic and once considered entering the
priesthood. There is also the issue of Thomas's very limited judicial
experience.
