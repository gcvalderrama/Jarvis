President Bush pledged to vigorously prosecute S&L fraud and not
interfere with the investigation of his son Neil, whose integrity he
defended. Neil described himself as "just a Denver guy trying to make
a living and raise a family." He held summer jobs with bank and oil
equipment companies, worked on his father's campaign a year, received
an MBA in 1979, negotiated oil leases from 1980-82, and started his
own oil company. He was a director of Silverado S&L from 1985-88 and
says he is considering a future run for Congress as part of a shakeup
to increase congressional accountability.
