Bill Clinton has to decide whether to leave Arkansas and run for
president, or to remain and guard his legacy.  The Arkansas
constitution mandates that whenever the governor leaves the state,
power passes to the Lieutenant Governor or the Senate President Pro
Tem.  Once before when he left, the President Pro Tem made twenty
appointments and demoted his chief of staff. Clinton, intensely
ambitious, is torn; possibly he could be a long-shot presidential
candidate.

He was elected governor at 32, defeated once, then reelected for four
more terms.

His accomplishments include educational reforms: he raised the sales
tax, investing the proceeds in improved schools.
