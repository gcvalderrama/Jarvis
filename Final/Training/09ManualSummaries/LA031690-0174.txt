As Terry Anderson began his sixth year as a hostage today, his
four-year-old daughter, Sulome, pleaded for the father she loves but
who she has never met to be released.

His family, friends and colleagues marked the somber anniversary with
commemorations and prayers in Washington, New York, and Cyprus.  In
Paris, former hostages chained themselves to a tree to protest
Anderson's captivity.  President George Bush vowed to continue to work
for the hostages' release.

Anderson is the longest-held American hostage in Lebanon.  Eighteen
Westerners, including eight Americans, are thought to be captives
there.
