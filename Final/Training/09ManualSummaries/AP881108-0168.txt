A study by the New England Journal of Medicine shows that Vancouver is
safer than Seattle because of its strict gun laws.  Between 1980 and
1986 there were 25 gun deaths in Vancouver, 139 in Seattle.

In Seattle handguns may be purchased for self-defense, and after a 30
day wait carried as a concealed weapon.

In Vancouver, a person may not purchase a gun for self-defense or
carry a concealed weapon.  Guns can only be fired at licensed shooting
clubs.

Gun organizations, the NRA and Citizens' Committee for the Right to
Keep and Bear Arms dispute the conclusions and advocate stricter
penalties.
