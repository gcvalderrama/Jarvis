California's Long Valley is a 19-mile caldera created 730,000 years
ago by an eruption 600 times larger than Mount St. Helens. In May
1989, new underground lava movement began triggering thousands of tiny
earthquakes and raising the valley floor. Residents refuse to heed
warnings, remembering a 1982 false alarm that damaged tourism and
aggravated a recession. Afterward, journalists were accused of
sensationalism and scientists of scaring people to get more
funding. Currently, 5-10 small quakes happen daily as the Earth's
crust is stretched apart and magma fills half-mile-wide chambers four
miles under the caldera, but the probability of eruption is less than
one percent.
