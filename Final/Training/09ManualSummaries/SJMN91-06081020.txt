Police now say that 21 officers were present as Rodney King was shot
with a stun gun and beaten about the head and body with clubs as he
lay hog-tied on the ground.  Witnesses say he was jovial and
intoxicated when he left his car.  California Highway Patrol officers,
who protested the beating, were ordered off the case by county
policemen, who continued the beating.

Their reports downplayed his injuries; four policemen have been
indicted for false reports and beating a suspect.  Highway Patrol
officers present, upset, took policemen's names and reported the
incident.

King suffered facial and ankle fractures and other injuries.
