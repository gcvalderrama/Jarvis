The Iranian Foreign Minister, Ali-Akbar Velayati, spoke to the
Security Council of the United Nations and gave the Iranian version of
the shooting down of an Iranian commercial Airbus.  He said that all
available evidence shows that the disaster could not have been caused
by a mistake by the crew of the Vincennes.  The huge difference
between the configuration of an airbus and a fighter renders absurd
any claim of mistaken identity.  He belittled such explanations by the
United States, and said that it was evident the warship took an
aggressive course and caused the massacre of 200 innocent people.
