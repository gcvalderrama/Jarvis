The issue of gun control stirs passionate responses on both sides.

Congress has passed the Brady Bill, the first legislation since 1968,
mandating a five-day wait on the purchase of a handgun, giving law
enforcement authorities time to check the buyer's background.

The NRA, with 3.3 million members, claims that legislation will not
stem crime; the answer is stiffer penalties, longer sentences and
abolition of parole.  Further they believe that gun ownership is
necessary to prevent takeover by a despotic government.  The Second
Amendment is their rallying point.

Gun Control has become a pivotal issue in many elections, influencing
who wins, who loses.
