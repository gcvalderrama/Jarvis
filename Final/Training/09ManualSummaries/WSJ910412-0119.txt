President Bush developed a coherent military strategy and political
coalition to defeat the aggression of Saddam Hussein.  Now, after a
brilliant military victory, the United Nations is committed to
implementing policies to destroy all remaining Iraq chemical and
biological weapons and missiles.  Although professing good will,
indications are that Saddam will attempt to obstruct these efforts.
His acts of cruelty toward neighbors demonstrate that he is not
trustworthy.  Will the U.N. and President Bush hold firm in their
resolve to force compliance on a deceitful Saddam?  If not, how can we
ever hope to promote and enforce a settlement to the Arab-Israeli
conflict?
