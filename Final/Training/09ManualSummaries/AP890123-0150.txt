An earthquake struck in the Soviet Republic of Tadzhikistan at 5
A.M. local time today.  It measured 5.4 on the Richter Scale. The
quake unleashed a 50-foot wall of dirt and sodden mud that buried two
small towns. The center of the quake was located about 25 miles
southwest of Dushanbe, the capital of the republic. It is estimated
that 1,000 are dead; most of them peasants who were buried beneath mud
as they slept. This is the second quake to hit the Soviet Union in
less than two months. A destructive quake in Armenia on December 7
registered 6.9 and left 25,000 dead.
