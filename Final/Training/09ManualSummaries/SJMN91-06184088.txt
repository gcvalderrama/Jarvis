Senate Democrats today pledged to examine the views of Supreme Court
nominee Clarence Thomas on abortion and other divisive issues while
Republicans supported the nominee and defended his right to remain
silent on issues that might come before the court. Civil rights groups
raised questions about Thomas's record as chairman of the Equal
Employment Opportunities Commission and said the fact that he was
African-American should not be an excuse for ignoring his civil rights
record. The Senate Judiciary Committee is expected to begin
confirmation hearings in September. Thomas, an unabashed conservative,
would succeed the court's leading liberal and first and only black
justice.
