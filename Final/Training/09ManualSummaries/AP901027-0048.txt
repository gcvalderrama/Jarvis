The birthplace of Terry Anderson marked the hostage's 43rd birthday
Saturday with a flag raising, a gun salute and two renditions of
"Happy Birthday."

About 40 people, including 12 of Anderson's cousins turned out at City
Hall for the gun salute and flag ceremony, then walked to a park to
join 500 others.

Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for the Associated Press,
was abducted by Muslim extremists in Beirut on March 6, 1985.  He is
the longest-held of the 13 Western hostages in Lebanon. Anderson was
born in Lorain, Ohio, and grew up in Batavia, N.Y., where supporters
decided against cake and signing to mark his birthday because of the
crisis in the Persian Gulf.
