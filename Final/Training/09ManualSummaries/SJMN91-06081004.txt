Bryant Allen, a King passenger, gave the first eye-witness account of
King's beating at the hands of police.  He and another passenger were
also manhandled and racially taunted and both are bringing civil
rights suits against the police.  None of the three have been charged.

Allen described King's behavior as erratic while driving that night,
and said he had trouble with his seat belt while trying to leave the
car on police orders.  He also said he heard a female officer tell
others that King had done nothing wrong.

There are calls in Los Angeles for Chief Darryl Gates'
resignation.
