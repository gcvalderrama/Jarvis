Today, a total eclipse of the sun darkened a wide area of Indonesia
and the southern Philippines.  The sun was blackened out by the shadow
(sic) of the moon for up to four minutes along a 108-mile swath that
moved from the Indian Ocean across Indonesia and the Philippine island
of Mindanao.  A partial eclipse was visible across a wide are of Asia,
from Japan to India.  In reactions to the eclipse, Indonesians prayed
and beat drums, Malaysian Hindus visited temples, Indian pilgrims
dipped into sacred waters, members of the Naragcas tribe in the
Philippines danced, and many Christian Filipinos went to church.  The
Chinese first recorded a total solar eclipse in 2137B.C.
