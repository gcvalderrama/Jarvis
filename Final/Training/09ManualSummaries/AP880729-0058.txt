A team of International Civil Air Organization experts arrived in
Teheran today, and is expected to remain in Iran for a week.  The ICAO
is a specialized branch of the United Nations and is based in
Montreal.  They are in Iran at the request of the Iranian government.
The team will start its probe in Teheran and then will go on to other
sites critical to the investigation.  The United States delegate to
the United Nations said that his country would help the investigation
in any way it could, but did not know if the team would be allowed to
go aboard the Vincennes.
