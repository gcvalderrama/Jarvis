Federal officials unconscionably delayed closing the troubled
Silverado Savings and Loan in Denver largely because Vice President
Bush's son Neil was on its board.  Silverado's loan portfolio was
described as comparable to a type of pyramid investment fraud known as
a Ponzi scheme. Neil Bush resigned from Silverado's board after his
father won the Republican nomination in 1988, four months before the
S&L's seizure.  The bank was closed on Dec. 9, 1988. There was
disagreement among bank regulators over whether Bush's presence on the
board affected their decisions. Bush said he would cooperate in any
way he was asked to.
