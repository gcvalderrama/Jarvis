Chinese commentator Yu Yen rebukes Hong Kong Governor Patten for
continuing to refer to Hong Kong as an international asset and seeking
international support for his constitutional package.  Yu Yen says
that Patten's continued insistence on this designation denies China's
sovereignty over Hong Kong.  Yu Yen asserts that because the Chinese
government understands Hong Kong, it was able to advance the policy of
"one country, two systems" and allow Hong Kong a high degree of
autonomy.  Other cities, Tokyo, New York, and Paris, are international
cities but that does not change their sovereignty.  Britain, he
believes, is unwilling to return Hong Kong to China.
