The older generation of South Africa's farmers say that the drought of
1992 is the worst since 1933.

Especially hard hit are the farmers who produce South Africa's main
crop, maize; stock farmers are also badly affected.

In 1933, drought forced farmers off their land. The state says that it
will prevent this from happening this time.

Imports of food could reach record levels, thereby compounding the
deficit problem. Unemployment caused by the drought, a depressed
economy and flat growth rate could add significantly to the state's
dilemma.
