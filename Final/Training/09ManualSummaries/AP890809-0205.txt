General Colin Powell is expected to be named the new chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff.  He became national security adviser in 1987
and heads the U.S. Forces Command at Fort McPherson in Atlanta,
putting him in charge of troop readiness and deployment for the
U.S. Army.  He has emphasized he is proud of the accomplishments of
the average U.S. soldier over the years.  In his time off, he tells
young blacks to spend their lives helping to open the doors for
minorities and tells of his battles with racial discrimination.  His
daily interest is keeping troops ready for combat.
