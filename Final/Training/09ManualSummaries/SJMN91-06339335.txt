Terry Anderson, the last American hostage in Lebanon, walked free
today of his pro- Iranian Shiite Muslim kidnappers.  His released
ended a brutal saga that kept 15 Americans in chains, left three dead
and bedeviled two U.S. presidencies.

A flurry of contradictory reports early in the day about Anderson's
whereabouts mirrored the agonizing cycle of raised and dashed hopes
for release from his 6.5-year ordeal.

Anderson's capture brought an outpouring of public support for the
captives and put intense pressure on the Reagan and Bush
administrations to get them out.
