Blame-shifters are making Alan Greenspan and his Federal Reserve scapegoats in 
the current recession.  Some are opposing his reappointment to a new four-year term in 
August.  Other potential candidates do not appear ready for the job and Greenspan has 
become Bush's biggest economic asset.  Bushes economic advisers and Congress who 
raised taxes three months into a recession are now expecting the Fed's to ease money 
supply and lower short-term interest rates.  If the recession persists too long, the solution 
may lie in a cut to capital-gains taxes, strongly recommended by Greenspan.  His main 
defenders are the financial markets and the American middle class.
