Four men and four women were picked today to spend two years inside a
two-acre sealed dome intended to be a microcosm of Earth.  Known as
Biosphere II, the giant terrarium aims for a December start.  It will
resemble a space colony tethered to Earth (Biosphere I) and serve as a
prototype for sustaining life outside the Earth.  The crew's world
inside will consist of seven ecological regions including a human
habitat of apartments, laboratory, office, and recreational
facilities.  Sponsored by Texas Financier Edwin Bass, the experiment
is meant to show ways of responding to environmental problems; e.g.,
pollution.
