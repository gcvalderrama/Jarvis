The Republican-controlled Office of Thrift Supervision delayed action
on failed Silverado S&L, where Vice-president Bush's son Neil was a
director, until after the presidential election and then lessened
charges of dishonesty against Neil Bush, which he denies. Bush
abstained from voting on forgiving $11 million that Kenneth Good owed
to Silverado but did not disclose that Good was paying $3 million for
an 80% interest in Bush's oil exploration company. Good denied
expecting Neil to influence Silverado's approval of loans to him. Good
and another Bush investor defaulted on more than $130 million in
Silverado loans. The Silverado cleanup could cost taxpayers $1
billion.
