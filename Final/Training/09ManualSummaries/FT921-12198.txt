Bill and Hillary Clinton appeared on "Sixty Minutes" yesterday to
refute charges by Gennifer Flowers, an Arkansas state employee and
cabaret singer, that she and Clinton carried on a 12 year affair.
Clinton denied the charges but confessed to "wrongdoing" in his
marriage on the program.

Flowers said the Republican Party in Arkansas had offered her money
six months ago to come forward but she refused. She sold the story to
a tabloid after Clinton angered her.

Clinton took a big risk in the TV appearance just three weeks before
the New Hampshire primary.  Polls show he fell 14 percentage points
last week.
