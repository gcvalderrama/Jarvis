A study conducted by Dr. Leo Kinlen of the University of Edinburgh and
E.  Rogot of the US National Institutes of Health shows that smokers
are more likely to die from monocytic and myeloid leukemias than are
non-smokers.  The data also suggested that even ex-smokers are
significantly more at risk than those who never smoked. Professor Wald
of St. Bartholemew's Hospital in London cautioned that no
cause-and-effect had been established but, he added, "the balance of
evidence suggests that smoking may cause leukemia."  He also wrote
that leukemia should be added to the World Health Organizations' list
of tobacco-related causes of death.
