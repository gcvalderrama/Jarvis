An article in the Wall Street Journal reports that problems abound in
the Brady Bill gun control proposal which mandates a 7-day waiting
period.  During that week law enforcement officials can, but are not
required to investigate the purchaser.  Part of the problem is a lack
of national criminal records; dealers have no list to check.

Another argument is that fewer than 20% of guns are purchased from
dealers and, there are already 150 million guns in circulation in the
U.S.

The Bush proposal, however, closes some of the loopholes for
punishment.
