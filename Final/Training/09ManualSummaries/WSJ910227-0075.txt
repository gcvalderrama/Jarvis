The Iraqi army is in full retreat.  Saddam has announced that he is
ordering it out of Kuwait.  Iraqi forces appear confused, battle-weary
and leaderless.  Prisoners are growing rapidly.  U.S. casualties are
minor; however, we still have not faced the elite Iraqi Republican
Guard.  The U.S. is intent on putting an end to Saddam as both a
military threat and an Arab hero without making him a martyr through
U.S overkill.  U.S. officials are prepared to cope with a hostile
Saddam after the liberation of Kuwait but are hopeful that forces
within Iraq will topple him within weeks or months.
