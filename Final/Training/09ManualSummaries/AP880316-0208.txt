An engine room fire Wednesday disabled a cruise ship off the Mexican
coast, but the crew extinguished the blaze.

The Navy cutter Vigilant escorted the 465-foot ship, the Scandinavian
Star, into port as a precaution, according to Chief Petty Officer Luis
Diaz of the U.S. Coast Guard in Miami.

There were no injuries from the fire, but a 71-year-old St. Petersburg
man suffered a heart attack and was being taken home aboard a Coast
Guard plane.

The Scandinavian Star was on a 3-day cruise to Cozumel, Mexico, and
was returning to St. Petersburg when the fire broke out about 8
a.m. EST Wednesday.
