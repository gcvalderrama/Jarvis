Mt. Unzen, the site of Japan's worst volcanic disaster which killed
15,000 people in 1792, erupted for the first time in 198 years on
Nov. 17. It erupted in early June killing 41 people. Rain swept ash
and rocks down rivers and the mudflow spread five miles. The volcano
is still spewing out gas, rocks and ash.

The Philippines' Mt. Pinatubo is in its fourth week of eruptions after
being dormant 600 years. 338 people were killed and $15 million damage
done to crops. Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval Base were severely
damaged. Low-frequency tremors were felt prior to the eruptions.
