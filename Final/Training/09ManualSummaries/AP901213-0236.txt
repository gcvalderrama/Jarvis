Columbia Savings & Loan Association has filed a $6 billion civil
lawsuit against Michael Milken and other former Drexel Burnham Lambert
officials. Milken, formerly head of Drexel's junk bond operations, was
sentenced last month to 10 years in prison for six felonies relating
to illegal trading practices, none involving junk bonds. The suit
alleges that the thrift lost more than $2 billion on investments in
junk bonds and seeks three times that amount under federal
racketeering and antitrust laws. It accuses Milken and others of
manipulating the junk bond market, giving bribes, misappropriating
valuable stock interests, and skimming profits.
