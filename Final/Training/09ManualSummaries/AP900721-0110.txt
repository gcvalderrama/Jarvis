The first total solar eclipse over Finland since 1945 will occur
Sunday.  The eclipse will begin at 4:03am (9:30pm Saturday EDT) when
the moon gradually begins moving between the Earth and the sun.  It
will end at 5:45am. Totality will last for 83 seconds.  About 10,000
people have converged on Joensuu, near the Soviet border, where
conditions are considered especially good for viewing.  The media have
been warning against eye damage.  Finn air has arranged a dozen
special flights for eclipse watchers.  The eclipse will be total in an
arc about 125 miles wide from the northern Baltic Sea across the Kola
Peninsula and northeast Soviet Union to the Aleutian Islands near
Alaska.
