Someone sat a fire early today in a storage room on the luxury liner
Regent Star, five days after the ship ran aground in Delaware Bay
after another fire cut off power, authorities said.

No passengers were aboard and no injuries were reported in the blaze
which was controlled in 90 minutes said a fire department dispatcher.

Just Sunday, the 20,000-ton liner was on its way from Jamaica to
Philadelphia when a small fire prompted a power loss, allowing the
ship to drift onto a sandbar.  None of the passengers were injured and
were taken off the ship by ferry on Monday.
