China threatened to ignore the results of democratic elections
proposed by Governor Patten for Hong Kong when China assumes control
in 1997.  But Lu Ping did say that China always stands for
co-operation, not confrontation.  These remarks relieved the Hong Kong
stock market which feared a more uncompromising stand.  Lu Ping
refrained from repeating economic threats made the previous year, but
it is unlikely that Britain will win China's agreement to complete the
Hong Kong airport project.  Britain's ambassador to China regretted
the personal attacks on Patten and said that decisions over Hong Kong
were taken by the British government as a whole.
