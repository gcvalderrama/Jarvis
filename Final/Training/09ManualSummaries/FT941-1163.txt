Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan, a former disciple of ultra-libertarian 
author Ayn Rand, is courting the Clintons, who are beginning to value his economic 
advice.  He even termed the administration's deficit-cutting measures as "credible."  
Greenspan maintains a low profile in Washington, although he is dating NBC reporter 
Andrea Mitchell.  He apparently considers the task of the central bank to be promoting 
economic growth as well as the controlling inflation.  He successfully maneuvered 
through the recession with many, small, interest cuts, but as the US economy flourishes 
he is being criticized for his gradual interest increases.  Greenspan still has the respect of 
Wall Street and no credible successor for 1996 has yet appeared.
