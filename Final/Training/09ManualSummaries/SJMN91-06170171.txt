When Mount Pinatubo first began to smoulder two months ago,
seismologists began to climb over the mountain and place their
recording devices at strategic points.  Pinatubo had a habit of
exploding with a force twice as great as Mount St. Helens.

After a few weeks of investigation, the scientists decided to
recommend evacuation of 84,000 people.  The warning was timely.  The
mountain erupted blowing hot ash and pumice 80,000 feet into the air.
This marked a turning point in successful volcanic forecasting.

U.S. officials, however, believe that the damage at Clark Air Base may
force the permanent closure of the base.
