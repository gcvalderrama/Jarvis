Cracks appeared in the U.N. trade embargo against Iraq.  The State
Department reports that Cuba and Romania have struck oil deals with
Iraq as others attempt to trade with Baghdad in defiance of the
sanctions.  Iran has agreed to exchange food and medicine for Iraqi
oil.  Saddam has offered developing nations free oil if they send
their tankers to pick it up.  Thus far, none has accepted.

Japan, accused of responding too slowly to the Gulf crisis, has
promised $2 billion in aid to countries hit hardest by the Iraqi trade
embargo.  President Bush has promised that Saddam's aggression will
not succeed.
