At the world's largest solar power plant near Barstow, an explosion
occurred Wednesday as third and fourth natural gas-fired oil heaters
were being brought on line. One of the heaters, used to back up the
solar heating system, exploded as a result of equipment malfunction
and set fire to a second, which also exploded. Two plant workers
suffered minor breathing problems. Fire and plant officials disagreed
on whether smoke from the burning oil was carcinogenic. The Harper
Lake plant is operated by LUZ International, which operates 8 such
plants in the California desert and had a fire at another solar plant
two years ago.
