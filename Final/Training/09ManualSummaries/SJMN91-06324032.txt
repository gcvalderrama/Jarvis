In a polygraph test monitors that are attached to the subject's body
measure physical responses, and little pens attached to the monitors
record the responses on a graph. The literal meaning of polygraph is
"many writings". Those who favor polygraphs usage say that when people
lie anxiety and fear of being caught cause involuntary changes in
blood pressure and the way they breath and sweat. Critics say they
have little credibility and that it is wrong to equate fear and
distress with guilt. The public pays attention to polygraphs when a
famous person takes one, usually when it is one person's word against
that of another.
