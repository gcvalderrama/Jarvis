As the Senate takes up Robert Bork' nomination to the Supreme Court,
Senators heatedly deny they have been misinformed about his beliefs.
He has been characterized as racist, sexist, sterilizer and bedroom
spy during his careers as a Yale law professor, U.S. solicitor general
or appeals judge.  There is ample evidence that Bork has been
reasonable, mainstream and unbiased throughout his careers.  Lobbyists
actually took a poll to find the best issues for distorting Bork's
views.  The liberal Advocacy Institute will hold a seminar on how the
left beat Bork.  The theme is that, "facts count, but symbols may
count even more."
