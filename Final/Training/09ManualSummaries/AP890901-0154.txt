Commander David R. Carlson authored an article in the current edition
of the United States Naval Institute Proceedings in which he was
harshly critical of the aggressive behavior of the USS Vincennes in
the Persian Gulf, and especially for the unwarranted shooting down of
an Iranian airliner. Carlson was the skipper of the USS Sides, a
frigate that was present in area when the shootdown occurred. A Navy
spokesperson said that the Naval Institute is not a part of the
Navy. Captain Rogers, who commanded the Vincennes t the time, said
Carlson's views were his own and not the Navy's.
