Last February, Miami-based Carnival Cruise Lines' 700-foot Celebration
cut a Cuban freighter in half in a collision off Cuba, killing three
Cuban sailors.

In March 1988, an engine fire broke out on SeaEscape's Bahamian cruise
ship, the Scandinavian Star.  Automatic fire extinguishers and the
emergency generator failed.

The National Transportation Safety Board said many foreign-flag cruise
ships that sail from U.S. ports have serious safety problems and the
potential for a catastrophic accident is significant.

The board is seeking both legislation and voluntary cooperation from
the industry to improve cruise-ship safety, which it says is marred by
the less-than-exacting rules governing foreign-flag carriers.
