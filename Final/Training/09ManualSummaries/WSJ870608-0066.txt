Opinions differ on how strong Alan Greenspan will be as Chairman of the Federal 
Reserve.  He has close ties to the traditional wing of the Republican Party and is 
considered anti-supply-side.  He has been called "a good consensus builder," a skill 
needed to manage the majority supply-side Reserve board.  He shares Reagan's pro-
deregulation views on banking issues and has excellent relations with White House Chief 
of Staff Howard Baker and Treasury Secretary James Baker.  However, he must keep 
enough distance from the White House to avoid compromising the Fed's independence or 
drawing Congressional interference.
