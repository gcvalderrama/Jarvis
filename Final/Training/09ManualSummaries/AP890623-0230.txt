Japanese investors and tourists are fueling an economic boom in Las
Vegas, spending or committing over $800 million dollars.  Yoshi
Morichika is heading up a 1,270 acre golf and destination resort
community for Japanese recreation and electronics giant Cosmo World in
nearby Henderson at a cost of $200 million.

Japanese businessman Katsuki Manabe has invested $30 million in the
Park Hotel in downtown Las Vegas and millions more in his Nevada-based
Sigma Games, which makes gaming equipment.

However, some Japanese investors are running into financial difficulty
with their investments and failing properties such as the Dunes and
the Aladdin hotels.
