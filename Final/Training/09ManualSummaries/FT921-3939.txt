International experts are being sent to southern Africa to assess the
effects of a severe drought on food supplies. Ten drought-stricken
countries are affected with Zimbabwe and South Africa in the most
severe condition.

These two countries, normally food exporters, must now import
substantial amounts of grain. It has been described as the worst
drought of the century, with about 15 million people at
risk. Additionally, the northeast of Africa, including Sudan,
Ethiopia, Somalia, and Djibouti, has also felt the drought.

The U.S. State Department believes that a huge donor assistance
program will be needed to avoid the crisis.
