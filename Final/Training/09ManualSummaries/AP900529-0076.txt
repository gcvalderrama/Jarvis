Radical reformer Boris N. Yeltsin triumphed over opposition from
Mikail Gorbachev to win the presidency of the largest Soviet republic
today.  After three hard-fought ballots in the 1,060-member Russian
Congress of People's Deputies, Yeltsin won 535, four more than the
majority he needed.  Gorbachev faces a formidable challenge from
Yeltsin, although a spokesman for the Soviet Foreign Ministry said the
election could strengthen Gorbachev's campaign for economic reforms.
Gorbachev actively opposed Yeltsin, telling the Russian Congress last
week that the platform of moving political and economic power from
central to local authorities would lead to "a breakup of the union."
