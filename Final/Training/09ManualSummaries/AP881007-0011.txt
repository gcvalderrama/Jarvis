The House Armed Services Policy Subcommittee heard testimony relating
to the destruction of an Iranian commercial airliner by missiles fired
from the USS Vincennes.  The Navy had earlier said that mistakes had
been made aboard the Vincennes in reading and interpreting data. In
testimony before the subcommittee, psychologists said that such
mistakes could be attributed to battle-related stress, and that the
military should put more emphasis on understanding stress.  One
professor added that when military people are at a high stage of
alert, as were the crew of the Vincennes, they are apt to interpret
data to fit what they expect to happen.
