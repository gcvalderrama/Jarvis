Chris Patten, Hong Kong's new governor will arrive in the colony in
July and find that five years from its reversion to Chinese
sovereignty, Hong Kong is thriving.  Southern China's exceptional
economic expansion has come to dominate local business sentiment.
Hong Kong appears to have come to terms with its future ruler.  Hong
Kong's factory owners in the bordering Chinese province employ over 2
million workers.  Hong Kong supplies China with 40% of its foreign
exchange and is the source of 60% of foreign investment in China.
Politics is now in full public view.  On June 30, 1997, Hong Kong will
be welcomed into China.
