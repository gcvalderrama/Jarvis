The captain of the Exxon Valdez has surrendered and bail is set at
$500,000.  His lawyer has not decided whether to waive extradition to
Alaska.  No people have been killer or seriously injured by the spill,
but the Prince William Sound fishing industry is disrupted and several
thousand birds and hundreds of sea otters are dead.  The quarter of a
million barrel oil slick covers an area the size of Delaware.  Almost
1 million barrels of oil were pumped out of the Valdez.  Exxon
officials will not estimate how long temporary repairs will take.  On
Wednesday, the normal flow of 2.1 millions barrels a day resumed
through the Alaskan pipeline.
