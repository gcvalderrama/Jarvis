Michael Milken's guilty plea to six felony counts makes it impossible
for him to claim in civil cases that he was not guilty of market
fraud. So many shareholders and investors have filed suits against him
that some attorneys are suggesting that Milken should file for
bankruptcy. Milken's attorneys, however, say that the $400 million
that he is required to provide for civil restitution will more than
cover any legitimate claims. The attorneys negotiated a plea agreement
designed so that little of what Milken admitted to can be used against
him in civil suits. Whatever the case, settling so many high-stakes
cases could be a long and tricky process.
