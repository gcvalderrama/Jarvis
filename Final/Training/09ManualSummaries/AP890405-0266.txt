Today, the still-leaking Exxon Valdez was refloated and began a
30-mile journey to Naked Island for temporary repairs.  Forty-two
million gallons had been transferred.  Ten million gallons of crude
were spilled, covering 2,600 square miles, soiling 800 miles of beach,
and killing thousands of animals.  The captain has surrendered.  The
flow of Alaskan oil, which had been cut by 60 percent, is returning to
normal.  Exxon, which continues to search for a dry dock for repairs,
has provided money to defend Prince William hatcheries.  Five
U.S. Navy oil skimmers are at work.  One hundred claims and at least
14 lawsuits have been filed against the company.
