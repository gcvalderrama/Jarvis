Alan Greenspan's caution as Federal Reserve Chairman has become legendary.  
He fusses extensively over economic statistics, always seeking more information.  He 
failed to make any announcement after the October 13 stock market plunge, claiming that 
he wanted to see what happened on Monday morning.  On Monday, the central bank took 
only modest steps to aid the markets and by the end of the week the federal funds interest 
rate dropped only .25%.  So far this caution had served the nation well, but there are fears 
that the Fed's reluctance to ease credit could lay the groundwork for a new recession, 
perhaps starting early next year.
