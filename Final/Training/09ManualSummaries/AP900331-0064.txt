Congress passed legislation that increases the minimum wage from $3.35
per hour, in steps to $4.25 in 1991.  Workers ages 16-19 may be paid a
sub-minimum training wage for the first three months and longer if the
employer has a formal training program.  Seasonal migrant farm workers
are exempt from the sub minimum which expires in 1993.  Even after the
increase, full-time workers would still be short of what it takes to
support one adult and one child at the poverty level.  Hundreds of
exemptions exist for some types of workers and for some small
businesses.
