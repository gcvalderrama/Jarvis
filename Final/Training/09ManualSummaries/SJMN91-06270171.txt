At 8:18 am, the four-man and four-woman crew stepped inside the 3.15
acre geodesic- framed compound, Biosphere II, for a two-year test of
space colonization technology.  Biosphere II consists of several
climatic zones--rain forest, savanna, ocean and marsh-- packed with
3,800 plant and animal species.  Communications apparatus connects the
crew with a control station a few hundred yards away.  Each member
will spend about four hours daily on farming and chores for
maintaining machinery driving the Biosphere.  Problems could crop up
after a month or so that would require the crew to leave temporarily
before returning for a solid two years.
