An undersea mountain named Loihi, SE of the Big Island of Hawaii, has
grown 10,100 feet from the Pacific floor and needs 3,100 more feet to
emerge as the ninth Hawaiian island.  The five main islands are tops
of volcanic mountains, formed when the Pacific Plate moved over the
"Hawaiian hot spot". Their ages are: Kauai, 5.6 million years; Oahu,
3.4 million years; Molokai, 1.8 million years; Maui, 800,000
years. Hawaii is under 700,000. Its two active volcanoes are Kilauea
and Mauna Loa. Loihi seems to be tapping the same source of magma as
Kilauea, which resumed erupting Jan 3, 1983.
