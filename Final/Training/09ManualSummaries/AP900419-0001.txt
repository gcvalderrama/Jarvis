A new drug developed at Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation appears
to be effective against hairy cell leukemia and may fight other types
of blood cancer as well.  The medicine, called 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine,
or 2-CdA is being called the drug of choice in the treatment of hairy
cell leukemia and is being tested against lymphocytic leukemia,
non-Hodgkins lymphoma and cutaneous T cell lymphoma.  Two other drugs,
interferon and deoxycoformycin, similar to 2-CdA, have been developed
in recent years but interferon is less effective and both produce side
effect.  The only unwanted effect of 2-CdA was a few days of
fever.
