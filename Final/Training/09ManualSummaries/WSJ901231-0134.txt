Las Vegas grew up in the 1980s from a purely gambling town to a
destination resort attracting families and conventioneers.  While the
gambling industry boomed, builders transformed the Las Vegas valley
into housing developments attracting residents from around the country
almost doubling the population.  Now the regional economy is beginning
to slow.

Many casinos have been laying off workers while thousands of new hotel
rooms are being constructed.  David Shulman, a Solomon Brothers
economist said that "Las Vegas is an accident waiting to happen."
Efforts have been made to keep Las Vegas from depending so heavily on
the gambling industry by permitting interstate banking but those
efforts have not been too successful.
