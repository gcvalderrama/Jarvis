Lt. General Colin Powell, who has been serving as Deputy National
Security Adviser, was named the new National Security Adviser last
week.  He appears to be the right man for the right job at this stage
of the Reagan administration.  General Powell, a genial and
plainspoken 50-year old, is well known within the tightly knit
national security establishment.  He has combat experience in Vietnam.
He has been a senior aide under three cabinet officers and 15 years
ago worked under Frank Carlucci, the current National Security Advisor
now appointed Secretary of Defense.
