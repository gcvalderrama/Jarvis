The cloud of dust and gases from Mt. Pinatubo's eruption last month,
over twice the size of Mexico's El Chichon in 1982, rose into the
stratosphere and covers 50% of the globe.  Sulfur dioxide in the plume
becomes sulfuric acid and etches airliner windows. The plume may
remain aloft for five years and is tracked by satellite. Suns appear
green and moons blue in tropical regions, and in northern autumn the
horizon will glow purple at sunrise and sunset.  In the past 80 years,
three eruptions may have had global climatic impact -- El Chichon,
Agung in Bali in 1963, and Pinatubo.
