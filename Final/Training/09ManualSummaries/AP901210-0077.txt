A natural gas explosion rocked an apartment complex for enlisted
personnel at Fort Benjamin Harrison Army base, killing a 5-year old
girl and injuring 17 residents and rescuers. Three people were still
listed in critical condition. Fire authorities were called in about
5:45pm, 3 hours before the blast, after people reported smelling
gas. The gas was turned off at the housing unit where the leak was
thought to be, but while that building was being evacuated, a unit
800-1000 feet away, where the gas had not been turned off, blew
up. The blast destroyed one four-family unit and damaged
another.
