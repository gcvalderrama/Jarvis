The Labor Department regulations banning the use of polygraph testing
will take effect in December. Critics of polygraph testing who claim
it is unreliable and demeaning are pleased, but most employers and the
companies that administer tests say that security will
suffer. Brokerage firms and banks have been among the most vocal
critics of the bill.  They have made wide use of polygraphs, and the
use has not been confined to low-level workers. Anyone, including
managers and executives, with access to negotiable instruments,
currency or securities, as well as confidential information, has been
tested.
