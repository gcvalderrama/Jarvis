"Junk bond" wizard Michael Milken has officially ended his 20-year
career at Drexel Burnham Lambert, Inc. and has announced plans to form
a new firm which will offer a wide variety of consulting services.
Milken started out in 1969 as a part-time employee at a Philadelphia
precursor to Drexel Burnham Lambert.  Within a decade his pioneering
use of high-yield high-risk junk bonds transformed Drexel from a
second-tier brokerage firm into one of Wall Street's most powerful
investment firms. Drexel's settlement with the SEC bans the company
from doing business with Milken who now faces a 98-count federal
criminal indictment.
