Michael Milken, the Drexel Burnham Lambert "junk bond" wizard who
revolutionized U.S. corporate finance has been indicted on federal
charges. The indictment charges that Milken used the firm of former
stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky to hide illegal stock trading. Boesky
pleaded guilty to a single criminal charge and gave prosecutors the
information that touched off the Drexel-Milken investigation. The
indictment further charges Milken with helping carry out tax fraud
through sham securities trades with Drexel and with straight insider
trading. The indictment asks that Milken, his brother Lowell and
partner Bruce Newberg forfeit a total of $1.85 billion earned in a
continuing criminal enterprise operated at Drexel.
