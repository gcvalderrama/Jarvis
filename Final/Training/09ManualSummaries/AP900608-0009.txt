Governor Bill Clinton won his sixth straight primary election by 55%,
a drop from previous years.  He has no cause for concern jokingly
citing the "tenure" issue, meaning, "ten years is long enough," used
by his opponent.

He counters, "a business wouldn't fire a 43-year old with ten years of
experience who's doing a good job."

Clinton has focused on improving Arkansas' educational system and
calls himself the candidate of change.

He was elected first in 1978 but lost in 1980.  He won again in '82,
'84, and '86, when the term was increased to four years.  He has
implied that if he is elected this year, he will not run for president
in 1992.
