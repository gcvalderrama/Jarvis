NASA scientist Richard B. Stothers, who studied the dates of strong
eruptions between 1500 and 1980, has disproven the theory that
volcanoes are more likely to erupt at certain times of the
year. Nearly all recorded eruptions south of 50 degrees south latitude
occurred between November and April because outsiders who could record
eruptions only visit that uninhabited region during its summer. No
similar pattern is seen in the far north, where residents are always
present. The peak monthly total of eruptions was 52 for February and
36 for both April and December, a statistical variation expected to
occur randomly.
