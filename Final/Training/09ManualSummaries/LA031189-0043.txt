Sharon Rogers, wife of captain Will Rogers III, escaped injury Friday
morning when a pipe bomb exploded under her van moments after she left
the van. The vehicle was destroyed. Mrs. Rogers was dazed but was able
to walk away. Captain Rogers is still the skipper of the guided
missile cruiser Vincennes that is now at San Diego following its
return from the Persian Gulf. In July 1988 missiles fired from the
Vincennes destroyed an Iranian airliner, killing 290.  The FBI said
the bomb was amateurish and shoddy, but did not rule out a connection
to a terrorist group.
