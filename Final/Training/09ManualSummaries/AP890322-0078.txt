House backers for increasing the minimum wage lowered their target to
$4.55 per hour as President Bush declared that they had the votes to
sustain a veto of any amount over $4.25. They also agreed to a
sub-minimum training wage, but for 60 days rather than the 6-month
period demanded by Bush.  Labor Secretary Dole said that most minimum
wage earners are young, part time, and living at home and not in
poverty.  The 60 day training wage would apply only to new workers and
exclude agriculture workers.  It could not be paid to workers hired to
replace recently laid-off employees.
