The earthquake that killed 25,000 in Armenia last December was the
largest contributor to the 1998 worldwide death toll, the largest
since 1976 when 255,000 died in a single quake in China. The year's
second deadliest earthquake occurred along the Nepal-India border on
August 20. It claimed 1,000 victims. Another Asian earthquake, this
along the Burma-China border on November 6 left 730 dead. Only three
were killed on August 6 in a quake on the India-Burma border. A Tokyo
area quake that killed ten was Japans' only significant quake in 1988.
