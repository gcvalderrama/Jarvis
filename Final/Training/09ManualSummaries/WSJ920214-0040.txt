Last week the Wall Street Journal published an article on how Clinton
avoided the Vietnam draft.

Like many his age, he wanted a draft deferment. Graduate school
deferments had ended.  His draft board told him he could expect to be
called in the fall of 1969; giving him extra consideration because he
was a Rhodes Scholar.  Clinton went back to Oxford.

Later he found an ROTC program at the University of Arkansas,
promising to enroll. He entered Yale.

Near his induction date, he ended his deferment and was placed in the
draft lottery; a high number ensured his exclusion.
