 research  report  increase  poas volcano   Rica 
 research country  find  unambiguous thing  possible 
molten rock  cause  gravity  microgravity  such case 
 Eggers  find  actual decrease   Guatemala  volcano   Pacayo 
small change  precede  volcanic eruption  certain type volcano 
 research country  go  take   Rica 
 research  know  happen 
 use  predict  measurement  gravity 
land level measurement accurate site  accompany  measurement  gravity 
 Rymer  speculate  possible 
 Helen Rymer  believe  possible 
and  Rymer  Brown  also begin  monitor  microgravity   Etna 
study  simple only measure  change  thing 
 Rymer  believe  and  also heat  or  molten rock  magma  water  make 
 Poas  again erupt  or   next
