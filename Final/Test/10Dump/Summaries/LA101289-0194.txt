Diabetes is a silent killer that afflicts one in eight Latino adults,
a rate higher than that of any ethnic group except American Indians.
Diabetes is a defect in the body's system for using sugar in the
blood.  It results from the body's failure to make insulin.  Latino
diets can be rich in high-calorie fried foods that promote obesity and
increase the chance of getting diabetes, most commonly Type II.  There
is confidence that Latinos will respond to educational efforts on
diabetes.  Examples of how educational programs can work are the
indications that Americans' risk of heart disease is lowering.
