Yugoslav press reports of possible normalization of relations between
Slovenia and Yugoslavia, emanating from Slovenia, are viewed with
distrust by Yugoslavs, who also insist that a Slavenian delegation
arriving here is a business group.  Further rumors suggesting that the
businessmen might be checking the atmosphere for possible political
contacts has not been commented upon or denied.

Slovenia is said to be considering the exchange of diplomats and the
abolition of visa requirements for Yugoslav citizens, possibly to
adapt its policies to those of the European Union, which Slovenia
hopes to join.

Yugoslavia believes Slovenia feels isolated because of its
estrangement from Belgrade.
