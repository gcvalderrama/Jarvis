Nelson Polsby, expert on Governmental Studies at Berkeley, but
expressing his own opinion, says term limits won't accomplish
proponents' goals.  His reasons:

* New candidates would need a huge outlay of money to gain name
* recognition.  Incumbents are more powerful in relation to special
* interests than novices.  Limitations won't improve legislative
* functioning because experience will be lost. Newcomers must learn
* from staff, lobbyists and bureaucrats, necessarily ceding power to
* them.  Term limits guarantee that good legislators will disappear
* with the bad.  Term limits will prevent voters from voting for those
* they favor.  Groups and interests want term limits to improve
* chances of electing favorites.
