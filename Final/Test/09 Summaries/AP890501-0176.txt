On Monday, Exxon released a revised plan for the cleanup of the
largest U.S. oil spill.  The tainted shores are divided into four
categories, from the most polluted to "lightly oiled".  The worst
areas would be targeted immediately and other areas gradually cleaned
before September 15.  The Coast Guard is reviewing the plan.  The
damage has spread some 500 miles from Valdez into Katmai National Park
and threatens bears and whales.  Several groups called for a boycott
Tuesday of Exxon products and attorneys general of three states called
for a federal investigation of gasoline prices which rose sharply
after the tanker accident.
