Germany has asked the European community to sanction Germany's ban on
British beef imports, claiming that the request is justified because
of the potentially grave health risks.  As of last week 121,898 cattle
in Britain had been diagnosed with "mad cow disease".  Over 8,000
cattle have died of the disease even though they were born after the
government had banned the processed feed suspected to be the source of
the disease.  Even with those discouraging numbers, and evidence the
disease has spread to other species, Britain maintains it is no threat
to humans, and that the German request is frivolous.
