A Wednesday tornado, one of a series in an arc spanning 7 states,
hopped a 25-mile path and carved a 3-mile stretch through Huntsville,
plowing through a school, shopping mall, apartments and rural
areas. It killed 17, injured 463 and left 1,000 homeless. Most dead
were in apartments, stores or cars. Wind, rain, and temperatures
plummeting to the 30s hampered the search for victims. A tornado watch
was issued earlier in the day but the tornado warning did not come
until 4:39pm, when the twister was already tearing up the city,
sounding like a jet at close range and bringing a deluge of
water.
