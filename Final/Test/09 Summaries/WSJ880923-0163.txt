Less than seven weeks after the worst fire ever recorded in
Yellowstone National Park, the Park's environmental researchers are
monitoring what they term amazing steps the forest is taking to renew
itself.  The research should play a major role in a new debate over
whether to reforest burnt areas or let nature take its course.
Critics of the "natural burn" policy say controlled burning, selective
logging, and reforestation are a better way to manage forests.  Park
researchers hope that the evidence being gathered will testify to the
forest's ability to renew itself as it has for the past 10,000
years.
