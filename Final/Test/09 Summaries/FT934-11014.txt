Two states, Wisconsin and Georgia, have received permission to reform
their welfare systems.

Beginning in 1995, two Wisconsin counties will cut off welfare
payments after two years, although families will continue to receive
food stamps and Medicare.

Georgia's plan would reduce payments to able-bodied recipients who
decline offers of work and refuse increases to families on long-term
welfare who have more children.

Vermont and Florida have proposed a plan to put time limits on welfare
benefits and await federal approval.

Mr. Clinton's welfare reform plan, a central theme of his campaign,
features a two-year limit; the plan has so far been delayed.
