On Saturday, 220,000 acres were ablaze, with 102,000 in Idaho and the
rest in Oregon, California and Utah. One storm laid down 2,000
lightning strikes an hour with little rain, then winds reaching 80 mph
and temperatures near 100 degrees whipped lightning strikes into major
conflagrations. Three-inch-thick burning branches blew up to two miles
ahead of the main fires. Five dry summers have left timber with a
moisture content close to kiln-dried lumber. After the last lightning
"bust" hundreds of fires burned fitfully in Idaho backcountry for
days. It will take fall rains and winter snow to douse many of the
nation's fires.
