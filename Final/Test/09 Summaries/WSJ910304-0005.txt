A United Airlines Boeing 737 jetliner crashed nose down near Colorado
Springs, CO, Municipal Airport, apparently killing all 25 persons
aboard.  There were no early indications on why the jet crashed.  One
focus is on whether there were unstable winds strong enough to cause
wind shear, a sudden, violent shift in wind direction that can smash
an airplane into the ground.  However, it is most dangerous when an
aircraft is at low altitudes such as shortly before landing or just
after takeoff.  When the jetliner crashed, it was a few miles from the
airport and thus at higher altitude.
