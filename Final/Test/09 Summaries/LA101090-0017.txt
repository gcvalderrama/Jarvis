Ross Baker, professor and author, writes on proposed term limits in
California and Colorado.  He reminds readers of the 22nd amendment
which he says hurt the Republicans, although they proposed it.  He
believes term limits are inappropriate for these reasons:

* Weak, short-term legislators will be controlled by governors,
bureaucrats and lobbyists.

* Legislators with term limits will aspire to higher office rather
than concentrating on their work.

* Lobbyists for special interests and unelected staff will grow more
powerful.

* Term limits are an indictment of citizenship; a statement that
voters cannot make good choices.

* Good legislators will be thrown out with the bad.
