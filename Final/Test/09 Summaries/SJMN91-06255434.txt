Critics see Virginia Thomas, wife of the Supreme Court nominee, as a
woman with strong opinions on issues which may come before the Court.
She lobbied against comparable-worth legislation for women, and once
belonged to Lifespring, a motivational group which troubles some
religious rights groups.  Some blacks see Clarence Thomas' marriage to
a white woman as a rejection of his roots and the black community.
Both Thomases believe that women and minorities have been hindered
rather than helped by affirmative action and government programs.
Virginia Thomas has worked for a Republican Congressman, for the US
Chamber of Commerce, and has been an official in the Labor
Department.
