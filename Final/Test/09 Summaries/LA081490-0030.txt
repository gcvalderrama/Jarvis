Forestry officials predict the 1990 fire season will be
devastating. The Yosemite fires, already scorching 15,000 acres and
still out of control, and the recent Santa Barbara and Glendale fires
that destroyed 500 homes, are only the largest of hundreds of
California blazes. Because of dryness, fires burn more rapidly and
intensely. During the four months of fires in 1988 at Yellowstone,
12,000 firefighters suffered respiratory problems. During one month in
1987, when 1500 fires attacked the Klamath National Forest near the
California-Oregon border, a strong inversion layer that settled into
the valley trapped thick smoke and crews fell ill in record
numbers.
