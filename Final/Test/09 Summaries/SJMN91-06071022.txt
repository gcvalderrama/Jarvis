Firefighting this year will be tougher because much military reserve
and National Guard equipment, and many pilots who are normally
mobilized against wildfires, are still in the Persian Gulf. Officials
plan an aggressive approach, putting out even small wildfires before
they spread, and deploying firefighters to areas where lightning
storms are forecast. The approach worked last year in Oregon's
Umatilla National Forest, where 170 fires were reported. In Santa
Barbara, where the drought is worst and where brush fires destroyed
600 homes and did $200 million damage last year, homeowners will be
compelled to remove vegetation near their houses.
