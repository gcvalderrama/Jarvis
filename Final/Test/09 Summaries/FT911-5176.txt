Lord Bauer, of Britain, believes we should not encourage Third World
nations to default on their debts.  He wrote to the Financial Times
that if loaned funds are used productively, debt service is not a
burden.  Material achievements decline as nations get away from
western commerce.  Domestic factors, policies, and dependence on
subsistence production cause poverty.  The poorest in a country are
the lowest priority and sometimes the victims of civil conflict and
ethnic or religious prejudices.  Harping on western causes of Third
World poverty is useless and encouraging nations to default will
inhibit further investments.
