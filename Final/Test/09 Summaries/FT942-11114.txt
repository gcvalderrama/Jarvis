The opening of the Channel tunnel later in 1994 is viewed by Belgian
authorities as an economic boon to the West Flanders and Hainaut areas
in Belgium.

Economic officials have seen the economy of Belgium deteriorate since
the 1980s. The Chunnel, with its new connections for freight and
tourists, will enhance the economy of West Flanders.

Belgium's ports, however, with the opening of the Chunnel, will suffer
some decline in sea traffic. There are already signs of increasing
economic activity in West Flanders.

Industrial and tourism zones have to be expanded to enable Belgium to
take advantage of the new activity.
