A United Airlines DC-10 crashed a half-mile short of a runway
Wednesday while trying to make an emergency landing at Sioux Gateway
Airport in Iowa.  At least 123 of the 293 aboard were killed.  Experts
speculated that an explosion of the tail engine sent shards of metal
through the tail section destroying lines serving the hydraulic
systems.  This was the worst in a recent series of accidents and
mishaps involving United.  Last February, nine persons died when a
United jet's cargo door blew open over the Pacific.  In July, damage
from turbulence forced a United jet to land at Miami.
