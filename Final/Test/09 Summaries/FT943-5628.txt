Venetia is De Beers' newest diamond mine.  Last year the mine more
than doubled output and processed 3.6m tons of ore to recover 4.96m
carats.  About 70% of Ventia's diamonds are of gem quality and
analysts suggest that at $100 a carat on average the mine is
generating annual sales of about $500 million.  When Venetia first
started up it was given permission to operate seven-days a week and
later went to five-day weeks.  The mine has revitalized De Beers'
production and accounts for half the output in South Africa and
replaces production from its 100-year-old Kimberley mines.
