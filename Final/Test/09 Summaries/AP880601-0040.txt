The 1988 hurricane season has begun, and a study shows that the death
toll could be far higher than previously predicted.  Bob Sheets,
director of the Hurricane Center, says coastal flood models show many
more people than previously thought would have to be evacuated.  43
million people live in east coast counties in the United States;
evacuation is considered nearly impossible, adequate shelters scarce
and condominium safety is questionable.

Two satellites track Atlantic hurricanes, but one may fail this year.

A typical hurricane season (June 1 to November 30) has 10 named
storms; six become hurricanes with drenching rain and winds exceeding
74 miles per hour.
