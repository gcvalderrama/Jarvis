At 12:30 am, the Exxon Valdez, a 987-foot tanker owned by the Exxon
Shipping Co., ran aground on a reef in Alaska's Prince William Sound.
The tanker reportedly was spilling 10,000 barrels of oil an hour, but
the leak had become a trickle by 2:30 pm.  Exxon reported that three
planes had been dispatched to the scene, another tanker was attempting
to pump out the remaining oil, and floating oil booms would be in
place by late afternoon.  Alaska Governor Cowper arrived in the
afternoon to evaluate the spill, which threatens wildlife and the
fishing and recreation industries.
