Health professionals of a Santa Clara Valley Hispanic Education
Program are offering nutrition and exercise classes in an effort to
educate Hispanics on the dangers of diabetes.  Health experts believe
that diet and genetic predisposition may be contributing factors to
the high incidence of diabetes among Hispanics.  Students will be
instructed to prepare traditional Hispanic dishes using
polyunsaturated oil rather than lard and to eat four tortillas
throughout the day rather than at one sitting.  Lessons on the
benefits of good nutrition and exercise to combat diabetes are offered
for the first time and they are geared to Hispanic lifestyle.
