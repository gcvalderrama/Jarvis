A T-2 Buckeye, a two-seat jet trainer, crashed Sunday on the flight
deck of the aircraft carrier Lexington in the Gulf of Mexico, killing
five and doing major damage to two other aircraft. The 46-year old
Lexington, the Navy's oldest carrier, is used exclusively for training
and was 17 miles south of its home port of Pensacola. The jet was
assigned to Training Squadron 19, based at the Meridian, Miss., Naval
Air Station. Because of Navy concern that fuel cells aboard the jet
might explode after being damaged in the crash, the Coast Guard sent a
team of ordnance experts to the carrier.
