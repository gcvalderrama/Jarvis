An anti-North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) rally in Richmond,
Virginia, drew a small number on Saturday.  The rally was aimed at the
three Virginian representatives still undecided on the NAFTA vote next
week.  The ralliers "mostly union members and Perot followers" claimed
NAFTA undermines the constitution, putting decisions in the hands of
international panels.  Companies and jobs would move to Mexico.  The
Virginia business community has been lobbying for NAFTA since March.
Anti-NAFTA forces declared they only have votes to give, while Clinton
has been promising projects for the districts of the undecided
representatives.
