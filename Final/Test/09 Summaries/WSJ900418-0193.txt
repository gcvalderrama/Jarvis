A Wall Street Journal editorial says Americans are overwhelmingly in
favor of term limits for members of Congress.  A Gallup Poll says this
opinion crosses lines of party, ideology and income.

Ninety-six percent of incumbents are reelected, many unopposed,
resulting in arrogance, a lack of accountability and a dearth of new
ideas.

While opponents say voters are to blame for reelecting incumbents,
campaign finance laws allow only incumbents to raise the money needed
to win.  Similarly, although opponents argue that citizens should be
allowed to vote for whom they please, they support the two-term limit
for the presidency, which tips power towards the legislature.
