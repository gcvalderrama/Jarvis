The war in the former Yugoslav republic is forcing Slovenia to look
for new partners in the European Community to compensate for lost
markets in the region.

Exports are low, at only 15% of previous figures, and industrial
production is down.  Although unemployment figures are higher,
inflation is lower thanks to a strong monetary policy.

Foreign automobile and other manufacturers assemble their products in
Slovenia and from there, distribute to other parts of Yugoslavia and
Europe.  Some Slovene products are exported to European community
countries, mainly Germany, Italy, France and Austria.

Parliament is now discussing a privatisation bill which will make
their enterprises more competitive.
