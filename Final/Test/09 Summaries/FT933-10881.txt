Foes of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) are mobilizing
with a small budget.  Actions include a Declaration of War against
NAFTA in California, and alternative dinner menus, featuring toxic
Mexican produce, for the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative in
Washington State.  The anti-NAFTA czar, Jim Jontz, has a campaign
office, field legislative directors, and organizations in 41 states.
President Clinton has not yet named his NAFTA czar, but supporters,
mostly within the business community, are spending millions to
convince Congress to pass the agreement.  Both sides are waiting for
side agreements on labor and environment to be finalized this
week.
