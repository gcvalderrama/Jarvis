Lawmakers are debating whether following the Constitution by counting
illegal aliens in the census results in a system that is unfair to
citizens.  Because there is a 435-seat limit, when one state gains a
congressional House seat, another must lose one.  Representative Tim
Valentine, D-NC, contends that counting illegal aliens grants
congressional representation to people who entered this country by
breaking our laws.  However, Representative Don Edwards, D-CA, argued
that every census since the Constitution was adopted has counted both
legal and illegal aliens.  It was never the intent of the framers to
include only citizens for apportionment purposes.
