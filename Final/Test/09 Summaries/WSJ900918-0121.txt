Iben Browning, a scientist who had picked the correct dates of four
large earthquakes since 1971 has said that the New Madrid area of
Missouri has a 50-50 chance of producing a magnitude 7 earthquake on
December 3rd.  He bases his predictions on tidal forces caused by
positions of the sun and the moon which, on December 3rd are expected
to be at a 27 year high.  Skepticism abounds and most earthquake
scientists say it is impossible to pick the exact day for an
earthquake.  Businesses in the area have capitalized on residents
fears marketing insurance protection and escape packages.
