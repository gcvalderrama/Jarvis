The "Chunnel" being dug between Britain and France is the largest of
current civil engineering projects. It will, say proponents,
revolutionize Europe's economy.  It will connect Folkstone, England
with Calais, France. The three-tunnel project is half-completed but 60
percent over budget. The British public does not express enthusiasm
for the project, fearing the import of "Continental ills."

France is building a high speed train (TGV) link to connect with the
tunnel; Britain, however, is dragging its feet on this aspect. Some
British believe that the absence of a TGV will leave Britain on the
fringe of the new economic boom.
