The Senate has voted to bar the Census Bureau from including illegal
aliens in the 1990 census.  Federal aid to states is frequently based
on these counts, so millions of dollars of funds that are made
available on a per capita basis could be affected.  A Senate-House
conference committee will soon decide if this Senate prohibition will
be retained in a Commerce Department appropriations bill.  Secretary
of Commerce Mosbacher said he would ask President Bush to veto any
bill with such a provision.  Undersecretary of Commerce Darby says,
"There really is a widespread realization that this would not only be
unconstitutional but literally impossible."
