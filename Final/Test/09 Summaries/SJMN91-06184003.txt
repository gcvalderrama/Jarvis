Clarence Thomas has risen in Republican ranks as an advocate of
bootstrap conservatism.  He would be a striking change from the man he
seeks to replace: Thurgood Marshall.  Thomas came of age in the world
that Marshall helped create but may be of a mind to dismantle
Marshall' legacy.  Conservatives, who support the nomination, and
liberals, who oppose, have only Thomas' opposition to affirmative
action as a guide to his views.  His views on controversial issues,
such as abortion, are not known.  Rights groups remain
cautious. Democratic senators who voted for Thomas for the Court of
Appeals say that does not automatically mean a vote for the Supreme
Court appointment.
