A US F-16C jet belonging to the 14th Tactical Fighter Squadron at
Misawa crashed today in Iwate, a remote forested area of northern
Japan, about 290 miles north of Tokyo. The pilot, Maj. Wyman
E. Vanedoe, ejected safely and was taken by Japanese rescue helicopter
to the US airbase at Misawa, 360 miles north of Tokyo. The aircraft
was on a routine training flight with two other F-16s in partly cloudy
skies.

On March 22, 1987, another F-16 crashed in the Pacific off
Misawa. That pilot also bailed out and was rescued by
helicopter. About 50 F-16s are stationed at Misawa.
