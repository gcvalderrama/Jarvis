Joseph McNamara is Chief of Police in San Jose, California.  Writing
an article for the Wall Street Journal of 5 April, 1991, he comments
on the videotaped beating of Rodney King by Los Angeles police.
  
McNamara shows that there is a code of silence by other police chiefs.
Racial jokes over police radios indicate it was not "an aberration" as
Chief Daryl Gates of the LAPD claims.

Gates is a racist, says McNamara and invites conflict.  Even his
reaction to the King videotape was defensive.

McNamara calls for a vocal repudiation of Gates' style of policing by
other police chiefs.
