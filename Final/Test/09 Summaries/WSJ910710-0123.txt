Slovenian's stocks, bonds and high spirits sank after their brief war
of independence from the Yugoslav Republic.  Bravado remains, however,
as Slovenians realize they can't turn back.  Still, they're not sure
how to go forward.

The European community has brokered a peace plan calling for three
months of negotiations with Yugoslavia.  However, Europeans are leery
of recognizing changed borders and Slovenes are disillusioned by this
perceived shunning by Europe and the United States.

Instead of the richest of the Balkans, they are now the poorest of
Europeans.

Their hopes of a prosperous future in the European Community hang on
expansion of trade and finding markets in the west.
