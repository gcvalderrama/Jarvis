Ben Johnson was stripped of his Olympic gold medal in the 100-meter final after testing 
positive for the banned steroid Stanozolol. Teammate Angella Issajenko says she too took 
Stanozolol and claims Johnson also took steroids when he set a 9.83-second world sprint 
record last summer in Rome, and those close to him were aware he knowingly took them. 
Dr. George Mario Astaphan provided steroids and monitored the program from 1984 to 
1986, with the knowledge of coach Charlie Francis of the Mazda Optimist Track Club, to 
which both Issajenko and Johnson belonged. Johnson went to Astaphan on his own after 
that.
