Hurricane Joan is moving across the Carribbean today on an unusual
course, after leaving 50 people dead or missing in Colombia.  The
storm flooded the town of Carmen de Bolivar, north of Bogata.
  
Hurricane watches were issued for Panama's north coast and San Andres,
in Colombia.  It is expected to drop four to eight inches of rain
along its path.  It is building in strength as it moves along,
contrary to predictions.

A high-pressure system to the north has kept the storm on its path,
unlike the usual northward push.

Joan is the 10th named storm of the 1988 season.
