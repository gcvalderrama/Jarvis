Almost a year after the Exxon Valdez oil spill, oil still covers the
beaches of Prince William Sound.  When Exxon suspended its cleanup
operations on September 15, between 50 and 75% of the oil still was in
the water, on the ocean floor, or on the beaches.  Thousands of sea
otters and seabirds were killed.  An October survey showed 117 miles
of beach moderately or heavily oiled. Exxon said no species was wiped
out, but the U.S. Fish and Wildlife officials say it could take 75
years to restore some of the bird colonies.  All parties appear to be
headed to court.
