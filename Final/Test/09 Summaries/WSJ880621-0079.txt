The World Bank is being criticized for failing to adequately respond
to the Third World debt crisis.  Reagan appointee President Barber
Conable clings to a traditional role for the bank as a
development--not financial--institution, supports the administration's
plan of loans to countries pursuing economic reforms, and rarely
intervenes in individual nations' crises.  Many economists and
politicians urge a more aggressive role.  A recent Conable study
suggests this may begin after Reagan leaves office.  The Third World
debt totaled $1.19 trillion last year.  In 1986, the 17 most heavily
indebted nations paid back lenders $18 billion more than they got in
new loans.
