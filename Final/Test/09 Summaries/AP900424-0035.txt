Liz Taylor, admitted last week to St. John's Hospital with pneumonia,
is breathing with assistance of a ventilator after surgery to
determine her pneumonia's cause.  She is listed in serious condition
in the ICU; however, her doctors say she is stabilizing.  Biopsy
results are expected Thursday.
  
Her four children are with her.

Explaining the biopsy, pulmonary experts said it's the best way to get
at the cause when a patient is not responding to antibiotics;
appropriate treatment can then be prescribed.
  
Miss Taylor had near-fatal pneumonia in 1961.  She has suffered health
problems for years, including back problems, addictions to painkillers
and alcohol and drug abuse.
