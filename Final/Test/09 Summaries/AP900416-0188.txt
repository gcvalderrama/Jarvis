"Village banking," one effort to ease world poverty, appears to
work. Envisioned five years ago by John Hatch, the plan is a system of
investment using small revolving loans to poor women to finance their
small, quick-turnover, private enterprises. There are now 400 village
banks, each with 40 to 50 women, in nine countries.  Portfolios total
$1.6 million and repayment is 96%.  Hatch has support from the
Catholic Relief Service, Rotary Club, and U.S. Agency for
International Development, and proposals pending with other
foundations and corporations.  Loans are small, but with quick
payback, low interest, and savings a woman's credit line
increases.
