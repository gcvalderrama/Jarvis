Many polls reveal the public is disaffected with the North American
Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), thought safe a few weeks ago.  Leading
the opposition is Ross Perot, candidate for president, who claims the
agreement would send jobs to Mexico.  Congress cannot amend the
agreement, but a vote cannot come until next year, after the
election. Supporters of the agreement, including Bush and Clinton,
will want strong environment, labor rights, and job assistance
packages.  Opponents such as Ralph Nader's Public Citizen believe the
public are becoming aware of the costs of NAFTA and talking to their
representatives.
