The House of Representatives' vote on the North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA) will be on November 16.  A simple majority of 218
votes is needed for passage.  Two factions that do not follow
conventional party lines exist. One anti- NAFTA leader characterized
the battle as the "elite" against the "populists".  The pro- faction
consists of the administration, the republican leadership, most big
business leaders, some democrats, and some prominent environmental
groups. The anti-faction includes labor, some democratic leaders
including most of the black and Hispanic caucuses,
ultra-conservatives, and Nader and Perot.  The stakes are high for
Clinton as his pro-NAFTA campaign goes into full swing.
