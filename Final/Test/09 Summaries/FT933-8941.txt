The De Beers South African Diamond Concern let one get away.  Now
investors are being asked to provide money for a diamond mine in
Zimbabwe.  De Beers found diamonds at River Branch in 1975 but decided
to move on to another site 60 kilometers away across the border in
South Africa. Mr. Robin Baxter-Brown, a new joint owner of River
Branch said that De Beers bulldozed the site before leaving.  Now that
site is estimated by joint venturers to have resources of 17.5m tons
containing 5m carats of diamonds.  Since mining started in March last
year it has produced 43,000 carats of diamonds Baxter-Brown
said.
