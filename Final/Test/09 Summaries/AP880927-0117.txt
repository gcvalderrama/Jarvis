Jamaican-born sprinter Ben Johnson broke the record for the 100-yard dash Saturday 
with his 9.79-second finish but was stripped of the Olympic gold medal he won for 
Canada when his post-win urine sample suggested he had used anabolic steroids to 
enhance his performance. The Canadian government suspended him from Canada's 
national team for life, pending an appeal. Johnson's family and a teammate from the 1984 
Olympics denied Johnson had used drugs. Sports Minister Jean Charest acknowledged 
hearing a rumor several months earlier that Johnson might be using steroids. Johnson was 
last tested in Canada in February at a Montreal laboratory.
