The Marine Corps Marathon will be today in Washington, D.C.  Naval
Officer, Lt. Guy Zanti will be running the 26.2 miles aboard the
battleship Wisconsin, where he is deployed in the Middle East.  He
became interested in marathon running in April when he watched his
53-year- old father run his first marathon.  Zanti's wife and father
will be running in Washington.  Zanti had been based in the
Mediterranean where he had planned to train, eventually running the
marathon on land.  The Wisconsin is 887 feet long, so it will take 75
laps of the ship to equal a marathon.
