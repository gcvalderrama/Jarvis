World-class sprinter Ben Johnson got knocked off track and field's pedestal and lost his 
gold medal in Seoul after testing positive for muscle-building steroids. At a news 
conference Thursday, as legislation was introduced to classify anabolic steroids as a 
controlled substance, Johnson told reporters it's wrong for athletes to use them, that 
they're bad for your health and it's wrong to cheat. Johnson was invited to attend by 
Representatives Mel Levine, Henry Waxman and Benjamin Gilman, presenters of the 
legislation, who applauded Johnson's courage in attending. Johnson later took the 
microphone and urged other athletes not to make the same mistake he did.
