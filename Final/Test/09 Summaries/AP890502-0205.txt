Rallies on Tuesday highlighted the boycott against Exxon.  The company
said that it was too early to tell if it was having any impact.  The
Coast Guard criticized Exxon's clean- up plans the same day, saying
they lacked specifics.  The U.S. Secretary of Transportation said he
expects the clean-up operation to double or triple by the end of the
month and that the cleanup will add $100 to $500 million to Alaska's
economy.  State and federal officials are calling for an investigation
into the rapid rise of gasoline prices.  The head of Exxon said it was
naive to think his company caused this rise.
