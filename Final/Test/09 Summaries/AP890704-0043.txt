Suspected communist rebels killed Col. Herminio Taylo, the chief
police officer of Makati. The city is the major financial center of
the Philippines, and is Manila's twin city. The killing occurred in
broad daylight, and witnesses said that the assassins identified
themselves as NPAs, referring to the New People's Army. In the last
two weeks ten law enforcement officers have been killed in the Manila
area. The slaying came one day after the formation of a special task
force to deal with assassins. President Acquino expressed sorrow, and
urged the military and the police to be more vigilant.
