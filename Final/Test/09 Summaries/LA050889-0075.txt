Rex Wilson of New Zealand, in only his third marathon, won Sunday's
Long Beach Marathon with a record 2:12:27 finish.  Wen Yanmin from
Beijing won the women's race in 2:43:33, also the course record.  Each
won $9,500.  Conditions at the start of the race were excellent with a
field of 4,021, the largest ever.  The humidity rose later in the
race, creating problems.  The women's finish was the most exciting
with Wen coming from behind near the end to beat Laura Konatz of
Toronto.  Tomio Bueyoshi of Japan finished second in the race.  Robert
Molinatti won the wheelchair division.
