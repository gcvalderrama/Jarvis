Poor farmers in Peru's Upper Huallaga Valley in the 1970s switched
from coffee and cacao to coca to meet the growing US demand for
cocaine, and hoping to become rich.  The Shining Path guerrillas began
wining support among those farmers because of anger with the
US-financed Peruvian anti-drug campaign.  In 1984-1985, the area was
in a state of emergency giving dictatorial control to the army who
prevented the anti-drug police from doing their work.  When it was
lifted, the army could no longer protect the "farmers", which opened
the way for the Shining Path.  The guerrillas presented themselves as
defenders of the farmers, but demanded a fifth of the coca crop and
exacted harsh penalties for resistance.
