Robert Goldwin, a scholar in Constitutional studies at the American
Enterprise Institute doesn't see the Second Amendment as a barrier to
gun control.  Reviewing the debates over the wording of that amendment
in the First Congress, he finds that much of their concern, especially
that of James Madison, was to limit the power of Congress to establish
a standing army and, instead rely on state militias.  One version that
was argued considered the "bearing of arms" as synonymous with "to
render military service" and another would require "every free
able-bodied white male citizen" to enroll in the militia.
