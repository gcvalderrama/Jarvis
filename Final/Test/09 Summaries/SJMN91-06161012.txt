Airline reservations, rental cars, and hotel rooms in prime viewing
areas for the coming solar eclipse are nearly impossible to get.
Hawaii and Mexico's Baja are the most favored areas because of usually
clear skies.  Hawaii may be the glamor viewing area, but crowds will
be greatest in Baja.  The eclipse will last longest, nearly seven
minutes, in the town of Tuxpan on Mexico's west coast.  Mexican
authorities, concerned about overloading of accommodations and
facilities will have a checkpoint at Guerrero Negro, halfway down the
peninsula and turn back travelers without evidence of
accommodations.
