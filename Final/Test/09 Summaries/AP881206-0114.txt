A B-52 bomber crashed at K.I. Sawyer AFB at 1:15am today while
practicing touch and go landings after a seven-hour training
flight. Another was damaged February 11th when a pilot aborted takeoff
at Castle AFB in California.

A B-52 with radar problems crashed October 1984 in Arizona's Monument
Valley after its wings clipped a mesa. Two crew died.

Four B-1Bs--the B-52's successor--have crashed, one smashing onto a
runway at Ellsworth AFB, SD, during a Nov. 17th training flight, and
one in a field near Dyess AFB, TX on Nov 8th.

Six crew died Oct. 11th when an AF tanker crashed at Wurtsmith
AFB.
