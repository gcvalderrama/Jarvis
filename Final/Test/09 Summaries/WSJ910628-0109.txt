Two days after Slovenia and Croatia declared independence, Yugoslav
troops battled Slovenian militia, surrounding the Ljubljana airport
and closing the borders with western nations.  The Slovene defense
minister acknowledged, "...Slovenia is at war."

Defense forces patrolled Ljubljana as government troops smashed
obstacles outside the city.  Further south, Croats battled minority
Serbs.  Near borders, civilians watched the fighting.

Slovenes, although shocked by the consequences of their declaration,
vowed with Croats to defend their independence.

The European Community, meanwhile, lobbied for a unified Yugoslavia,
while the United States urged a compromise solution.

Serbia insists on a strong federal government, while Slovenia and
Croatia have wanted a loose confederation.
