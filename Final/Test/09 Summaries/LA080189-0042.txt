The season's first hurricane, Chantal, headed for the Texas and
Louisiana coast today after capsizing an oil drilling ship, trapping
an estimated 10 men inside.

Up to six crewmen were rescued by Coast Guard helicopters and boats.

Worsening conditions prevented divers from searching the wreckage, and
the effort was called off by afternoon.

Chantal was declared a hurricane (74 mile per hour winds) and expected
to reach land later today.  Meanwhile, coastal residents began
preparations, buying bottled water and other necessities.
  
Flooding is a major concern for the Houston area, which expects high
winds, rain, and tides five to seven feet above normal.
