The tuberculosis rate in American prisons is three times higher than
on the outside according to the Center for Disease Control, who urge
testing, isolation and other measures there.

Large correctional systems in New York, New Jersey and California
report even higher increases in the mid-eighties.  Overcrowding in
prisons puts inmates, staff and visitors at high risk for the airborne
infection.

The CDC recommends testing for new inmates and staff and annually
thereafter, and isolation for confirmed symptomatic cases.

Spread of the AIDS virus may play a role in the TB increase in
prisons.  AIDS weakens the immune system.
