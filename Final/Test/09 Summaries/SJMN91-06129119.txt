A practicing attorney in Santa Clara recently wrote an item for the
media in which he describes a case of police brutality against a
suspect involved in a high speed chase.

The suspect is caught and brutally mauled by police, although not
resisting arrest.  The brutality is covered up by the police but there
are four witnesses who state otherwise and describe the beating.  The
officer is later arrested and prosecuted.

The article's author mentions the problem of police secrecy in
discipline cases and emphasizes the need across the board for
citizen's review boards to track complaints about the police.
