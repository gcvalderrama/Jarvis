Abebe Mekonnen from Ethiopia won the Boston Marathon in 2:09:06, with
Juma Ikangaa from Tanzania second.  The women's winner was Ingrid
Kristiansen of Norway in 2:24:33, with Marguerite Buist second.  The
winners earned $45,000.  Kristiansen finished 26th overall, believed
to be the highest finish for a woman in this race.  Ethiopian runners
won three major marathons in two days, winning in Rotterdam and Milan.
Although Ethiopia boycotted four of the last five Olympics, it has a
long history of marathon success, with runners training at high
altitude to enhance aerobic capacity.  Joan Benoit Samuelson, course
record holder, had her worst performance.
