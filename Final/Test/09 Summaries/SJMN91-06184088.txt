Some Democratic and Republican senators have differed on the extent to
which Supreme Court nominees should have their views on controversial
issues brought out in confirmation hearings.  Confirmation hearings
for Clarence Thomas are to begin after Congress' August recess.
President Bush has rejected suggestions that his selection of Thomas
is to replace a black with a black.  Some Democratic senators are
expected to oppose the selection but at this point, the party's big
guns, Judicial Chairman Biden, Majority Leader Mitchell, and Edward
Kennedy say only that they promise a thorough review of the
nomination.  Thomas declined to answer questions on his legal views
until then.
