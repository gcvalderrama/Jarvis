Wildfires started by lightning, fireworks and vehicle exhaust pipes
were combated over the July 4 weekend in various parts of the country.
The areas most affected were: Utah's Zion National Park; Montana's
Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness Area and Custer National Forest;
Wyoming's Bridger-Teton and Shoshone National Forests, and Yellowstone
Park; California's Yosemite Park and Los Padres National Forest;
Michigan's Hiawatha National Forest; and various wildlands in Kentucky
and Tennessee.  No injuries or serious property damage were reported.
Forest Service policy is to allow wilderness fires to burn unless they
threaten rails or structures or are about to spread outside the
wilderness area.
