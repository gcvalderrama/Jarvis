The Los Angeles County district attorney's office declined Friday to
press charges against Elizabeth Taylor's physicians for allegedly
overprescribing pain-killers.  They said the investigation was ended.
  
While agreeing that their treatment fell below medical standards,
authorities said the doctors had also attempted alternative means of
dealing with the addiction, and treatment was "...devoid of criminal
intent."

The report said one physician had tried repeatedly to persuade Miss
Taylor to enter a rehabilitation facility but that she refused until
October of 1988.

Miss Taylor, 58, has admitted to a 35-year addiction to sleeping and
pain-killing medication and has been treated at the Betty Ford
clinic.
