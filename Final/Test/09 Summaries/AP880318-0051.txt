Thousands of people in parts of Indonesia and the Southern Philippines
reacted to a total eclipse of the sun which lasted nearly four minutes
on March 18, 1988.  A partial eclipse was visible in a broad area from
India across southern Asia and Pacific Islands and into the Gulf of
Alaska.  Philippine President Corazon Aquino flew to Davao, 650 miles
south of Manila to view the event.  About 20,000 tourists and
scientists went to the Philippines for the eclipse.  Thousands of
Asians conducted religious and traditional observances during the
eclipse.  The next total eclipse to affect this area of the
Philippines is at least 50 years away.
