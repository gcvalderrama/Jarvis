Sprinter Ben Johnson, 26, surrendered his Olympic gold medal for running the 100-meter 
dash in 9.79 seconds, a world record, after the muscle-building illegal steroid Stanozolol 
was found in his system. He said only that he still had his family's love and suggested 
someone was pleased his medal had been taken away. His personal physician, Dr. George 
Astaphan, denied dispensing steroids.  Johnson tested negative for drugs in August and 
passed eight tests in two years. Johnson's father, Ben Johnson, Sr., lives in Falmouth, 
Jamaica and Johnson's sister Claire Rodney and mother Gloria, to whom he had 
dedicated his medal, live in suburban Toronto.
