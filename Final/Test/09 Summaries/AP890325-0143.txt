On Saturday, more than 10 millions gallons of crude oil had created a
slick 7 miles wide in Prince William Sound.  The cleanup equipment at
the site was declared inadequate.  Divers said they had found six to
eight holes in the hull of the Exxon Valdez.  Operations to move the
remaining oil into the Exxon Baton Rouge were delayed while a boom, to
contain leaks, was placed around the two tankers.  The tanker's
captain and two crewmen were subpoenaed.  Four Coast Guard's
strike-team members arrived also on Saturday.  National Transportation
Safety Board investigators are expected on Sunday to begin the
accident probe.
