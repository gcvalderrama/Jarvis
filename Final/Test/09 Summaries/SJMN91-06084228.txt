On Sept. 24, 1988, Ben Johnson, who immigrated to Toronto from Jamaica as a scrawny 
14-year-old, set a world record and won a gold medal for running 100 meters in 9.79 
seconds at the Seoul Olympics. After testing positive for illegal steroid use, Johnson's 
gold medal and record were revoked. In a book, former Johnson coach Charlie Francis 
says he gave athletes every steroid combination imaginable and they all wanted to use 
them, and Johnson harmed his times by jubilantly raising his hand as he approached the 
finish line. Johnson is running again after a two-year suspension, attempting a comeback 
for the 1992 Barcelona Olympics.
