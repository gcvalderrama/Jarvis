Hurricanes are to be expected in the tropics, but the Miami area has
been spared since 1964 when Cleo struck.  Previously, huge storms hit
Miami in 1916 and Key West in 1935 with catastrophic damage and loss
of life.

Experts at the National Hurricane Center now worry about a "big one,"
overdue after 27 years.  The area has been greatly built up in the
interim and 90% of residents of barrier islands say they would not
evacuate in a hurricane.

Experts at the Center, who track storms closely, feel the laws of
probability are closing in on Florida.
