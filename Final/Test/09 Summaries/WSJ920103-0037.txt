Edward H. Crane writes in response to Robert Barro's letter to the
Wall Street Journal opposing term limits for Congress.  Mr. Crane
finds Mr. Barro's view, that we should have confidence in the wisdom
of the electoral process, naive and dewey-eyed.

Mr. Crane strongly supports term limits because:

1.  Less time in Washington with constant press attention would permit
less press corruption of common sense and growth in self-importance.
Indeed, some congressmen feel their opinions should be codified.

2. Short terms would allow congressmen seniority sooner and be less
likely to interrupt productive careers, indeed become a "leave of
absence," giving Congress a greater diversity.
