Firefighters in various states battled holiday weekend fires, which
blackened more than 6,000 acres of forest and wilderness areas.  Those
areas most affected were: California's Stanislaus National Forest;
Utah's Zion National Park; Montana's Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness and
Custer National Forest; Wyoming's Shoshone National Forest and
Yellowstone Park; Michigan's Hiawatha National Park; and Arizona's
Tonto National Forest.  Forest Service policy allows wilderness fires
to burn unless they threaten trails or structures, or threaten to burn
outside the wilderness boundary.  Cooler temperatures and calmer wind
helped control fires in Montana.

Rain slowed or damped the fires in Wyoming's National Park and Forest
areas.
