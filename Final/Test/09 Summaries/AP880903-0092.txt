President Reagan says he'll veto any welfare legislation that doesn't
have a work requirement.

Unemployment is down and the economy is expanding, but those caught in
the welfare trap are being left behind, Reagan adds.  He has asked the
states to come up with their own welfare plans, and says over half the
states have implemented or proposed such plans.

With Congress close to a decision on welfare reform, he says he'll
insist on work being part of the plan.

The House bill provides for training and education, child care and
health care provisions.  House Democrats say if work is required the
states should manage such provisions.
