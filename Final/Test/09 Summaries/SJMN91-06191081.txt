The beating of black motorist Rodney King by Los Angeles police
officers has brought the formation of a panel to investigate the
department.  The panel, specifically focusing on racism and brutality,
neither blames nor exonerates the department's chief, Daryl Gates.

The panel did uncover racially derogatory messages passed on computer
terminals of police cars.  Black police officers related their
experiences with racial harassment and the existence of double
departmental standards.

One organization said that black and Latino minorities view the Los
Angeles Police as a white, male-dominated organization that has
subjected them to years of brutality and ignored their
complaints.
