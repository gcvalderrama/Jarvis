Rebuilding began in Louisiana to repair the devastation of Hurricane
Andrew which killed two people and injured dozens.  Local officials in
Florida, also hit by Andrew were critical by the delay in supplying
food, drinking water, and other supplies.  Federal officials
acknowledged problems but promised "dramatic improvements".  President
Bush ordered troops to Florida but specified no number.  One of every
eight Dade County homes was wiped out. The alligator industry and
cotton and sugar cane crops there are threatened. Louisiana oil
refineries were barely affected and crude oil deliveries were expected
to resume.
