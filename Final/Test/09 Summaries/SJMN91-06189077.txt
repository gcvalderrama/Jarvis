Eclipse watchers flocked to Hawaii and Mexico in anticipation for the
July 11 solar eclipse.  The Baja area of Mexico will get the largest
influx because of its easy access from the US and since the eclipse
duration will last longest there.  Mexico's government has formed an
Intersecretarial Commission to oversee production of protective
viewing lenses.  Sun-worshiping Aztecs in ancient times viewed
eclipses as bad omens.  A futuristic escape from eclipse threats was
proposed by "Angel" of the Intergalactic Guardian Command who
advocates taking spaceships to the fourth dimension.
