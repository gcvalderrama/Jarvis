The assassination of a third presidential candidate has pushed
Columbia close to political chaos. The latest victim, Carlos Pizzaro,
candidate of the M-19 movement, was killed Thursday. Senator Lusi
Carlos Galan, candidate of the Liberal Party, was assassinated last
August. Bernardo Jaramillo, candidate of the Patriotic Union Party,
was killed last month in Bogota. The Medellin drug cartel is being
blamed for the assassinations. In the past nine months the drug
traffickers, acting against government steps to rein them in, have
killed nearly 300 Columbians. The government appears helpless. Some
suspect that the armed forces are allied with the drug traffickers and
right-wing death squads.
