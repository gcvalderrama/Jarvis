The De Beers diamond empire, controlled by the wealthy Oppenheimer
family of South Africa face an uncertain future.  The black majority
in South Africa threatens De Beers largely because of a newly
energized political will.  The African National Congress has pledged
to nationalize South Africa's major sources of wealth if it takes
power.  De Beers must this year renegotiate five-year contracts with
Botswana, the second biggest diamond producer in terms of value, and
Argyle Diamonds of Western Australia, the biggest producer in terms of
quantity.  Apparently attempting to limit risk, De Beers recently
announced it would split South African and foreign interests into two
publicly held companies, one based in Switzerland.
