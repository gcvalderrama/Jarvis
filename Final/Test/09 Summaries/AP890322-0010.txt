Police brutality and racism are terms not usually applied to the
Minneapolis Police Department.  The city prides itself on its
tolerance.

That was not the case during a recent drug raid when two blacks died
and later during a confrontation between blacks and police.

Protesters demanded that the officers involved be suspended and are
calling for a police review board, which the police chief opposes.

A city official stated that police racism has existed for over 21
years despite the public impression of tolerance.

The chief of police said cultural awareness training for his force
would begin in the fall.
