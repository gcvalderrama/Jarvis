Meteorologists use satellites and supercomputers to track hurricanes.
The resulting models embody all the world's knowledge about
meteorological conditions and changes.

The path of hurricane Hugo was predicted using this information.  More
difficult is predicting changes in intensity.  In Hugo's case, the
increased wind speed was detected by Air Force Reconnaissance,
upgrading Hugo to a Category 4 hours before it hit Charleston, South
Carolina.
  
Satellite information is fed into computers in Suitland, Maryland,
then to the Hurricane Center, where the tracking model constantly
changes, following the storm.  Using this data, history and the
storm's path, the meteorologists guess the probable landfall.
