Congressman Larkin Smith (D-Miss) died in a light plane crash in
Mississippi Sunday.  Smith was the second House member to die in an
aviation accident this week.  Representative Mickey Leland (D-Tex) and
15 others were found dead Sunday after their plane crashed on an
Ethiopian mountainside.  Smith was a police chief and then a county
sheriff coordinating anti-drug efforts of federal, local, and state
agencies across five states.  Last November, he was elected to
represent Mississippi's 5th Congressional District, replacing Senator
Trent Lott (R-Miss).  He was developing a reputation on the House
Judiciary Committee as a zealous opponent of illegal drugs.
