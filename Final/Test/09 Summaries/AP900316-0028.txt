Federal health researchers find that TB's decline has almost stopped
due to its threat to the AIDS-infected.
 
In 1988, 22,436 TB cases were reported, down 0.4% from 1987.  From
1981-84 a 6.7% drop occurred.

The Center for Disease Control attributes the change to the increase
of TB among HIV infected persons who have AIDS making them susceptible
to illness, including TB.

The TB increase was higher among blacks and Hispanics; both groups
have higher rates of AIDS.

The CDC estimates 10 million Americans are infected with TB, but most
will not fall ill.  115,000 were in treatment in 1987, while 1,753
died of TB.
