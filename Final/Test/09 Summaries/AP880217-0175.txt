Forty Congressmen teamed with the Federation for American Immigration
Reform in suing the Census Bureau to force the agency to delete
illegal aliens from its count in 1990.  The group contends that the
estimated two million or more illegal aliens will cause unfair shifts
in House of Representative seats from one state to another.  The
Bureau says it is required by the Constitution to count everyone,
regardless of citizenship.  Prior to the 1980 census, a federal court
upheld this approach.  Representative Tom Ridge, R-Pa., suggests
devising a system to count illegal aliens, but then disallowing their
numbers for reapportionment purposes.
