Micro-enterprise lending is now booming.  U.S. development groups
believe this support to grassroots enterprises is a way to export
free-market economics and fuel growth in the developing world.  One
group, Accion, plans to increase micro-lending in Latin America to
$66.5 million this year and expand to between $500 million and $1
billion by 1996.  Other participants include CARE of New York, Trickle
Up, and Save the Children.  Some Third World banks are paying
attention.  Individual loans are between $50 and $500, while repayment
rates continue to be above 90%.  The U.S. Agency for International
Development has doubled its micro-enterprise budget from 1988.
