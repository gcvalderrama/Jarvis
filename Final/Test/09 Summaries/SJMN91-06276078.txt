Poor ventilation in modern office buildings is causing spread of flu
and other airborne infections including measles and tuberculosis,
according to public health experts.  One office building reported an
outbreak of TB among 40% of workers, traced to one sick employee.

Many modern buildings are sealed to conserve energy, recirculating
indoor air.  Airborne infections may be carried throughout buildings,
infecting workers far from the source.

The amount of outdoor air in such buildings needs to be increased.

Airplanes, waiting rooms, homeless shelters, prisons and hospitals are
likely sites for spreading infections.
