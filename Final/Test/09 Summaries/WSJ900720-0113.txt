Peruvian police scored a coup against Shining Path by discovering an
archive and memorabilia repository of the organization.  However, this
success fell short of the claim by the Interior Minister that the site
was a headquarters and that the fight against the guerrillas was
almost won.  Peru ranks as one of the world's worst human-rights
offenders and the war between the government and Shining Path has cost
nearly 20,000 lives.  Alberto Fujimori will soon take over as
president, and it is believed that he will emphasize economic
development rather than military actions against Shining Path.
