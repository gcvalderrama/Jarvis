As President Reagan prepares his State of the Union address next week,
the Wall Street Journal offers advice as to what the focus should be
for his final years in office.

In his second inaugural speech Reagan promised to make welfare reform
a priority.  Additionally, the public is said to be exasperated with
the huge amounts spent each year on welfare.

The Domestic Council's plan would give latitude to the states to
experiment; however, Congress, beholden to the welfare lobby, may not
be as anxious as the governors.

The president needs to challenge Congress to respond to his
initiatives.
