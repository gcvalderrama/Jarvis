The Bank of Boston's decisions to write off $200 million in loans to
less-developed countries and place most of its Third World loans on a
non-accrual basis are expected to have major repercussions.
U.S. banks are split into two groups: large, money-center banks with
thin reserves against Third World loans, which hope of collect on
these loans, and smaller, regional institutions, with few Third World
loans, which establish big reserves or declare such loans
uncollectable.  If the major banks were to follow the regionals' lead,
they could dangerously reduce common equity/assets ratio levels, some
far below the 4% accepted as prudent.
