A USAF F-111 fighter-bomber crashed Wednesday on a training mission in
Saudi Arabia, killing both crew. A USAF F-4 Phantom reconnaissance jet
crashed there Monday, killing two pilots. Two Marine Corps UH-1 Huey
helicopters crashed over the Arabian Sea hours earlier, killing all
eight crew. An F-15E also crashed in the gulf area.  A C-5 ferrying
equipment to the gulf crashed in West Germany.  20 other aircraft,
including 15 helicopters, have been involved in non-fatal accidents in
the gulf area since Desert Shield began. USAF Desert Shield war planes
have been grounded for 24 hours.  The number of accidents was not
unexpected for a 700-aircraft operation.
