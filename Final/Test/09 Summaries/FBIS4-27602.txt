The President of South Korea, Pak Chong-hui, was assassinated on
October 26, 1979 by then Central Intelligence Agency Director Kim
Chae-kyu. The investigation of others involved in the killing is still
going on 15 years after the murder. Yesterday there was news out of
Seoul concerning that investigation. One member of the joint
investigating team said that there was no concrete evidence that
General Chong Sung-hwa had been involved in the killing. Chong,
indicted in December 1979, is still not in the clear, but a formal end
of the probe is expected soon.
