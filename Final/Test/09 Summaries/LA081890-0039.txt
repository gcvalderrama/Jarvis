America's Finest City HomeFed Half-Marathon will be held Sunday in San
Diego, beginning on the Point Loma Peninsula and ending in Balboa
Park.  Alphonce Swai, a 1984 Olympian for Tanzania who dropped out
because of alcoholism, hopes to continue his comeback that began in
May.  Other favorites include Carlo Ayala and Jose Luis Chuela of
Mexico, and Sam Sitonik and Sammy Rotich of Kenya.  The women's field
is led by Kim Jones of Spokane, Washington; Janine Aiello of Taos, New
Mexico; Lynn DeNinnof of St. Louis; and Kathryn Evans of Fort Collins,
Colorado.  The course is considered to be very difficult.
