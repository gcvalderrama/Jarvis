The German government will sponsor study at seven German universities
and research institutes to examine possible connections between bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and two rare human
diseases--Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and Gerstmann Straussler syndrome.
Some scientists are concerned that BSE can be transmitted to humans
who consume tainted beef or medicine.  1n 1992 Germany imported 2,105
tons of British beef and veal.  A German proposal to ban these imports
will be discussed by European Union health ministers next week.  More
than 100,000 cattle have died in Britain, and BSE has killed 50 Swiss
and 2 German cattle.
