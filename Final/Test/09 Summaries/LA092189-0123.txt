A French DC-10 jetliner with 171 people aboard blew up at high
altitude before crashing in a desert region of Niger.  There is
speculation that the jetliner was bombed by terrorists in retaliation
against France for sending a naval task force into Lebanese waters to
rescue French nationals in war-torn Lebanon.  Many perceived the
action as support for Maronite Christian forces against Syrian troops
and Muslim militia in Lebanon.  Several militant groups threatened
attacks against France in August.  The states of Iran and Libya are
under suspicion.  Seven Americans, including the wife of the US
Ambassador to Chad, were aboard the plane.
