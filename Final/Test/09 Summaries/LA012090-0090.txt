Landscape contractor Owen Dell studied the effects of the 1977
Sycamore Canyon fire that destroyed 200 homes, jumping from house to
house but skipping others. He realized that landscaping had a
relationship to the amount of devastation. Dell, the city government
and fire department, and volunteers began planning the Santa Barbara
Firescapes Demonstration Garden to educate the public about reducing
the risks of wildfire near their homes through landscape design. No
plant is fireproof but some are more flammable than others. The most
flammable native flora like oaks, ceanothus and manzanita should be
planted farthest from the house, and sparsely.
