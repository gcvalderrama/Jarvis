According to an Agriculture Department analysis of nine "drought
region" states, the 1988 drought was not as bad as it might have been.
Crop yields plummeted but commodity prices rose.  For those who eked
out some production, or had grain stored, it was not too bad.  A basic
finding was: despite the drought, farms in all areas of the country
continued to improve their solvency position in 1988.  In the drought
states, 62.2% of the farms were in favorable financial positions,
compared to 62.8% in 1987.  Debt position improved due to an upward
trend in land values and higher market prices.
