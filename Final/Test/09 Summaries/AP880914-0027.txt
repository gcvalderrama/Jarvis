Hurricane Gilbert is headed for the Yucatan Penninsula with winds of
175 miles per hour - one of the worst recorded in the western
hemisphere, with the lowest atmospheric pressure and greatest area.

Gilbert is one of three category 5 storms recorded here, according to
meteorologist Jesse Moore.  Others were a 1935 storm, and Camille in
1969 with 172 miles per hour winds that killed 256 people and
inflicted $1.4 million damage.  The worst, (Galveston, 1905), killed
6000.

The storm surge - a dome of water following the eye across coastlines
- accounts for 90% of fatalities.
