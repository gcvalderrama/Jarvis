Brush and trees that surround many Southern California neighborhoods
are being dried out and killed by prolonged drought, bark beetles and
a rare fungus. They would be tinder-dry fuel for fires, creating
potential for one of the worst wildfire seasons in decades. Some of
the most vulnerable fire zones abut densely developed residential
districts of Los Angeles and its suburbs. A densely thicketed acre of
hillside chaparral contains about 60 tons of brush, with about the
same fuel energy as 3,750 gallons of gasoline. With 80 mph winds like
September's Santa Anas, a fire can consume 100 acres a minute.
