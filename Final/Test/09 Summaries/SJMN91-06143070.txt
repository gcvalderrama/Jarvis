Rajiv Gandhi, Indian Prime Minister from 1984 to 1989, was
assassinated Thursday while campaigning in the state of Tamil
Nadu. His grandfather and his mother also served as Prime Ministers
and Congress Party leaders. Political observers say that Thursday's
assassination signals the end of a dynasty. Gandhi's Congress party is
being challenged by a center-left coalition and a right-wing
party. The election's first phase occurred on Monday, but the second
and third phases have been postponed to the 12th and 15th of June. The
military and paramilitary forces are combating widespread violence.
Guerrilla forces in Tamil Nadu are the prime suspects in Gandhi's
murder.
