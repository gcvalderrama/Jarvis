Chicago had undergone two days of hearings on police brutality by 30
September 1989.  A report describing widespread segregation shows that
much work remains to be done on race relations.

The mayor, Richard M. Daley, son of Mayor Richard J. Daley who ruled
Chicago as mayor for 20 years until 1976, was elected to office
promising empowerment to minorities.  He gave 11 of 21 cabinet posts
to minorities.  Blacks charge the police force with brutality,
intimidation, beatings and false arrests.  Lack of contact among the
city's ethnic groups may be one cause.  The black police chief faulted
himself for any failures.
