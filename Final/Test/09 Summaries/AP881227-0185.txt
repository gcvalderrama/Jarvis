Shining Path (Sendero Luminoso) began in the mountains but is moving
into the shantytowns that surround the capital.  The Maoist rebels are
becoming a political force and the poor residents in these areas are
ideal recruits.  Most of Peru is in economic collapse with an
inflation of nearly 2000%.  In the cities, the guerrillas combine
conventional politics with terror.  Enrique Bernales, chairman of a
committee on violence, said violence does not result from poverty
alone, but from humiliation, oppression, class hate, and racism.  The
Maoist founder of Shining Path gave his first interview since going
underground in 1980, saying that conditions were ripe for staging a
coup against the president and provoking economic chaos.
