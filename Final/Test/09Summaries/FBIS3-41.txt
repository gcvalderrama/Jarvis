La Republica, an anti-Fujimori newspaper accepts a statement
attributed to Shining Path leadership as a peace proposal but cautions
that it may be a temporary tactical retreat by the terrorist
organization. They may have published the statement to discredit
President Fujimori.  Fujimori has claimed hat Peru has recovered the
initiative in confronting the Shining Path.  But the paper believes
that in the eyes of Shining Path leader Abimael Guzman it is merely an
armed truce until after the year 2000, when the organization would
resume it terrorist campaign.  Fujimori had promised to wipe out
Shining Path by 1995.
