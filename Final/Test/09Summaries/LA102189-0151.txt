The Orange County Social Services Agency said that excluding illegal
aliens from the census would show a county with 200,000 fewer
residents than its actual population.  The lower figure would result
in an estimated $56 million loss each year in federal revenue.  Santa
Ana, home to 44.5% of the county's Latinos, estimates it was
shortchanged 50,000 people in the 1980 census, which cost it
approximately $2.2 million each year in state and federal revenue.
Efforts in including illegal aliens in the census received a major
boost when negotiators from the U.S. House-Senate conference committee
worked out an agreement on the issue.
