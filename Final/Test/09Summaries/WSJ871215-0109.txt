In an editorial in the Wall Street Journal the merits of the Family
Welfare Reform Act of 1987 are questioned.  The bill is scheduled for
debate by the House today.

The Journal suggests the Act merely expands existing programs without
reducing overall welfare dependency.  It also points out that less
than 25% of the expenditure will go toward reform such as
welfare-to-work programs, and really amounts to an expansion of the
status-quo.

The editorial suggests welfare reform should: 1. shrink the deficit
2. reduce incentives to remain on welfare, and 3. make work the focus
of the system.

The House bill falls short of these goals.
