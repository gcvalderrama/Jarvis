Coastal populations have increased dramatically and the potential
damage from hurricanes has increased as well.

At the same time, means of forecasting and tracking hurricanes are threatened.
One of the two weather satellites has failed and the Air Force wants to end their
involvement in manned weather reconnaissance flights.

Bob Sheets, head of the National Hurricane Center, says the
replacement satellite won't be ready for two years. He also fears that
more hurricanes are occurring and are likely to strike the United
States with its highly populated coastline.

Last year, 505 persons died in Atlantic huqrricanes.
