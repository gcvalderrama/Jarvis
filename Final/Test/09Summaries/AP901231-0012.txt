Mexico is forming elaborate plans months in advance of the "solar
eclipse of the century" which will occur on July 11.  The 165 mile
wide path extends from Hawaii, across Mexico to Brazil and the area
will go dark for almost seven minutes, the maximum length of time for
a total solar eclipse.  The Latin American rainy season may hamper
viewing.  Eclipse 1991, a Mexican government commission, expects a
huge financial gain for the country.  Tourist facilities are heavily
booked and expected to reach capacity.  Ships are being prepared to
serve as floating hotels and viewing platforms.
