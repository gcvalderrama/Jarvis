Clarence Thomas, President Bush's nominee to join the increasingly
conservative Supreme Court has, over the years, undergone a dramatic
political and philosophical transformation.  As a youth, he shared the
liberal attitudes of many bright young black people who came of age
after the freedom rides.  As a Holy Cross College student in the
1960s, he joined black protesters, he had a wall poster of Malcolm X.
At Yale Law School, where Thomas was admitted while an affirmative
action program was in effect, he began his transformation to his
present ideology.  Some critics attribute his transition to
conservatism as opportunism.
