In a blow to California, the Senate voted to bar the counting of
illegal aliens in the 1990 census.  Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif. said
the vote is unfair to states that have a huge influx of immigration
beyond legal limits.  State officials believe California could lose up
to $300 million in federal aid if illegal aliens went uncounted.
Santa Ana estimates its potential loss at $2 million a year.  Concern
was also expressed that this measure would promote fear and
intimidation in the Latino community.  Sen. Moynihan, D-N.Y., believes
that "Fiddling with the numbers" now will destroy confidence in the
census results.
