Harry Oppenheimer of De Beers will visit Russia next week when the
republic is considering a big shake-up in its diamond
industry. Oppenheimer, former chairman of De Beers, and his son
Nicholas will be meeting senior officials from the Russian diamond
industry. He will be going to some of the big mines in Siberia and
will be present when De Beers holds the formal opening of its Moscow
office.  De Beers signed a five billion- dollar contract for uncut
diamonds in 1990 with the former Soviet Union. After a break- up of
the Soviet Union the De Beers contract was continued with
Rosalmazzoloto, the Russian gold and diamond organization.
