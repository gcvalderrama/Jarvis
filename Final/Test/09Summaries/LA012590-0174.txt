On Wednesday, Exxon announced its net earnings for 1989 at $3.8
billion, down from $5.26 billion in 1988.  This drop came even though
revenue was up $7.5 billion and was attributed to the financial effect
of the Exxon Valdez oil spill.  The cleanup cost $1.38 billion in 1989
and Exxon expects to spend another $500 million.  Exxon still must
reimburse Alaska, the U.S. Coast Guard, and other federal
organizations.  Exxon stock fell by 12.5 cents, closing at $47 a
share.  Its poor performance will probably continue with the bad
publicity accompanying the spill and the trial of the ship's
captain.
