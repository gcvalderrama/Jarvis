Rain and higher humidity helped firefighters whip blazes in six
Western states.  A fire along New Mexico's Diamond Creek, southwest of
Albuquerque, forced the rescue of hundreds of endangered fish.  The
creek was contaminated by ash from the lightning-caused Divide fire.
In California, one fire was contained on the coastline near Big Sur,
while another at Camp Pendleton continued to burn.  Fires were also
contained in Colorado west of Forest Collins in the Roosevelt National
Forest, the Boulder Canyon, and the Mesa Verde National Monument; in
Arizona's Mongollon Rim area; in Nebraska's Pine Ridge area; and in
Wyoming's Bridger- Teton Park.
