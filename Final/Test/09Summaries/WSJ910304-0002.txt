Incidence of active TB rose 38% in New York in 1990 according to the
Health Commissioner, Dr. Woodrow Myers.
  
The city is responding with tuberculosis clinics and increased funding
for prevention and intervention, including TB testing for homeless,
housing for those found positive, increased preventive measures for
drug abusers and testing for children entering school.

They estimate one million New Yorkers may be infected by the TB germ;
but it is inactive in 99%.  Those at high risk are those whose
capacity to resist infection is impaired, such as those with HIV,
substance abusers, cancer or poor nutrition.
