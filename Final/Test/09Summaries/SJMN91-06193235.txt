The San Jose Mercury News was providing readers with information
concerning timing of the coming solar eclipse and viewing hints and
warnings.  In the Bay area the eclipse will peak at 10:20 AM and last
for 24 minutes but only about half of the sun's diameter will be
blocked.  No one should look directly at the sun even with ordinary or
makeshift sunglasses.  Viewers should look at the shadows or punch a
hole in a piece of paper and look down at the shadow.  Without
precautions, serious eye damage can occur.
