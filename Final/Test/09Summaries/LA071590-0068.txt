Since July, 1988, the Ventura County district attorney's office has
refused to prosecute a number of suspects arrested by police who
contend that they were victims of police brutality and filed charges.
The public defender's office believes that this is a rare occurrence.

Typical was the police response to complaints about a loud party.
Without provocation, police began beating three of the partygoers.
Police arrested one of the men on grounds of resisting arrest and
assaulting an officer.  Later, the latter charge was dropped.

A similar sequence occurred in several other cases.  Reasons for case
dismissals included "lack of evidence."
