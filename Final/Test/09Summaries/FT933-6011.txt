The Financial Times says welfare is synonymous in American minds with
crime, fatherless children, urban decay and drug abuse.  They suggest
that Clinton's program of welfare reform subliminally suggests a war
on all those problems.

Welfare, however, has become a lower priority for the administration,
after deficit reduction and healthcare reform.

Many conservatives favor a time limit for AFDC: when the time is up
they must accept low-paid jobs or give up their children.

Some suggested a Roosevelt-like work plan: after two years recipients
would be given low- paying government jobs.

Clinton's "workfare" scheme might be more humane and effective.
