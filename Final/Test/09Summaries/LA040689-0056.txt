The captain of the Exxon Valdez surrendered to police in New York City
on Wednesday.  He had been fired after being found to be legally
drunk.  The 240,000-barrel slick is now estimated to be affecting an
area the size of Delaware, with only 5% of the crude picked up so far.
Alaska has condemned Exxon's cleanup efforts.  The refloat of the
Valdez went well.  The Port of Valdez was closed at 10:00 am and will
remain closed until the Valdez anchors near Naked Island for temporary
repairs.  The flow of oil in the Alaskan pipeline returned to normal
on Wednesday.
