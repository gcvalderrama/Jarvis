World authority Tetsuya Theodore Fujita has studied tornadoes for 42
years. In his University of Chicago lab he creates miniature
tornadoes, with a bottom fan making a swirling motion and a top fan
simulating a low-pressure system's updraft. Miniature versions, like
real tornadoes, are impossible to redirect or squelch. Single, large
thunderstorms are likelier to produce tornadoes than groups of storms,
which compete to rotate "which they all can't do." Most strong
tornadoes are actually 6-7 small ones rotating around a larger
tornado's center. The Fujita Scale ranks tornado strength, with a zero
breaking twigs on trees and a five ripping houses from
foundations.
