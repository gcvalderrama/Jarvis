William Gray, an atomospheric scientist from Colorado State
University, told the National Hurricane Conference to expect about six
Atlantic hurricanes in the 1988 season, which starts on June 1.  Gray
said the average 1988 hurricane will likely be more intense than those
of the past six years, adding that meterologists' models cannot
predict when or where they will form.

He believes recent African droughts have lessened Atlantic hurricane
activity but this will likely change, adding that the increased United
States coastal population makes that area more vulnerable to damage
than in the past.

Grays predictions have been close to accurate in the recent
past.
