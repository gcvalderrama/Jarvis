Chile is the world's most seismic country.  It has 2,270 miles of its
coast located along an earthquake fault.  A few months before the
great San Francisco earthquake of 1906, an 8.5 quake destroyed the
Chilian city of Valparaiso.  Chile has the distinction of having the
strongest earthquake ever recorded: a magnitude 9.5 in 1960 struck an
area about 600 miles long in Southern Chile.  That quake caused the
coast south of Concepcion to drop nine feet and killed 5,000 people in
the sparsely populated area.  Tsunamis from it caused damage as far
away as Hawaii and Japan.
