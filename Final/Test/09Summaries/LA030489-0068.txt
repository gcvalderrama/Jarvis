On January 14, 1989 a white Long Beach policeman, Dickey, pushed a
black man, Jackson, through a plate glass window after a routine
traffic stop.  The incident was taped by a news team as part of a
sting operation arranged by Jackson, an undercover policeman.  The
objective was to prove charges of racism and brutality by the Long
Beach Police.

Several investigations have begun.  Dickey has discredited his own
report of the incident.

Dickey also hurt Jackson by bending his fingers and refused to loosen
handcuffs.

Jackson told a hearing that he is committed to upholding the law as an
anti-brutality specialist.
