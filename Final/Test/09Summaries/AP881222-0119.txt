A new computer study reported Thursday that this year's drought in the
Midwest may have been caused, April through June, by ocean temperature
abnormalities near the equator in the Pacific Ocean.  During that
period there were alternating high and low pressure centers across
much of the Pacific northern half of the Western Hemisphere.
Temperatures ranged up to 5.4F below normal in an extensive band along
the equator.  A bit to the north, they ranged 0.9 above normal.  When
fed into the computer, the pattern of stationary alternating high and
low pressure systems was produced. Associating these temperatures with
drought will require more computer modeling.
