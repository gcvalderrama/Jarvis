Carlos Pizzaro, the presidential candidate of the M-19 movement, was
gunned down Thursday on a plane enroute from Bogota to
Barranquilla. It is suspected that the assassin, who was killed
immediately, was employed by the Medellin drug cartel.  Pizzaro was
the third presidential candidate to be killed in Columbia. The
Patriotic Union Party candidate, Bernardo Jaramillo was assassinated
22 March. The government has refused a request to postpone the May 27
election. Senator Luis Carlos Galan, candidate of the Liberal Party
was assassinated last August. Since then more than 250 Columbians have
been killed by the drug traffickers.
