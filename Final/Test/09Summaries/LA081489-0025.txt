The wreckage of a plane that crashed against a mountain in Ethiopia
Sunday with Texas Congressman Mickey Leland and 15 others aboard has
been located by US rescue and recovery teams.  Leland, Chairman of the
House Select Committee on Hunger, was making his sixth tour of refugee
camps.  He was accompanied by congressional staff members and
officials of the State Department, Agency for International
Development, and the Ethiopian government.  Indications are that the
passengers and crew died instantly.  President Bush and House Speaker
Thomas Foley highly praised Leland for his sense of compassion and
desire to help those in need.
