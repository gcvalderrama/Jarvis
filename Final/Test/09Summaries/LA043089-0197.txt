The Coast Guard confirmed on Saturday that oil continues seeping from
the Exxon Valdez and a complete cleanup is impossible.  It probably
will not be moved for at least a month.  Exxon reported that it has
paid $500,000 to 150 fishermen on lost work claims and is processing
another 300 claims.  In Juneau, the state Senate passed six bills
reacting to the Valdez disaster.  These bills involved the state's
spill-response capabilities, plans and funding; increased fines for
spill damage; and created a commission to investigate the Valdez
spill.  It is unlikely that the House can act before adjourning on May
9.
