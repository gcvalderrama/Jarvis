Cloudy, rainy weather threatened to ruin viewing of a total solar
eclipse in Finland on July 20.  Best viewing, weather permitting would
be in the eastern town of Joensuu and about 10,000 people, including
foreigners have gathered there.  The eclipse begins at 4:52 am in
Helsinki and ends at 5:45 am with the total phase lasting for 83
seconds.  Finnair has arranged flights for some viewers to go above
the weather to view the eclipse. The eclipse will be total in an a 125
mile wide arc in northern arctic areas.  The last total eclipse viewed
in Finland was in 1945.
