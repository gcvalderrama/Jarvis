Hispanics in the U.S. are divided over the North American Free Trade
Agreement among the U.S., Canada, and Mexico.  Some groups are
demanding agreements to protect worker rights and the environment, and
an administration plan to retrain displaced workers. Leader of
important Hispanic coalitions fear Hispanics in the United States will
bear the brunt of the negative impact, since recent immigrants are
dependent upon those elements of the U.S. economy most vulnerable to
Mexican imports.  They are proposing a trilateral North American
Development Bank to aid regions most affected.  Hispanic business
organizations are backing the agreement and consider it a giant
opportunity.
