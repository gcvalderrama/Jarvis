A death squad opposed to the Shining Path threatened to kill district
Attorney Carlos Escobar if he investigates charges that soldiers
killed dozens of peasants.  Escobar is investigating charges that
troops rounded up peasants and accused them of being Shining Path
members and killed them.  The Rodrigo Franco Command has vowed to kill
a Shining Path member or sympathizer for every person slain by
guerrillas.  The command, which is named for a government party
official killed by the Shining Path, killed the lawyer for the number
two man in Shining Path, Osman Morote.
