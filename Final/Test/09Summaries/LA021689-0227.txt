Ben Johnson's personal physician, Dr. Jamie Astaphan, said the Olympic sprinter took a 
banned steroid on one occasion last May, four months before the Seoul Olympics, when 
he was depressed by a hamstring injury that threatened to end his rivalry against Carl 
Lewis for the 100-meter gold medal. Astaphan claimed Johnson bought Stanozolol or 
somebody bought it for him in Toronto, but immediately after taking it he suffered 
violent muscle spasms and was brought to Astaphan, who nursed him back to top 
condition. Johnson says he never knowingly took performance-enhancing drugs and 
Astaphan denies prescribing them for any Canadian Olympic athletes.
