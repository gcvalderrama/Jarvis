A brushfire was thought to be contained on October 19th, but blossomed
into the intense, unpredictable firestorm that devastated the Oakland
hills. Water pressure dropped as electricity failures shut off
pumps. Six of California's 10 most damaging wildfires have occurred
since 1980, as Bay Area residents have moved farther into hills and
canyons.  Recent fires are bigger, more expensive to put out, and
cause more property loss. In 1985, a Los Altos Hills fire destroyed
100 acres and 12 homes--a year after residents repealed an ordinance
requiring fire-retardant roofs--and a six-day fire above Lexington
Reservoir scorched 14,000 acres and destroyed 42 homes.
