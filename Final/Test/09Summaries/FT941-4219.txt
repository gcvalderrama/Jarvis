The "Chunnel" between Britain and France will open on 6 May 1994. This
may begin a recovery of the property market in northeastern France and
Kent, England. Bargains are available.

Examples in France are: a water mill for FFr900,000; an 18th century
house for FFr450,000; and a Norman house near Dieppe with furniture
and a cottage for 125,000 pounds.

On the British side are the following: an apartment in the Grand
(Hotel) at Folkstone for 89,000 pounds; and a late 18th century house
for 190,000 pounds.

It is a good time to buy, on either side of the tunnel.
