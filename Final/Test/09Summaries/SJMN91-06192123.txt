Guatemalan members of the Brotherhood of the Mayan God Maximon plan
traditional celebrations during the coming solar eclipse.  They will
burn incense, ring church bells and wave farming tools to scare away
the gargantuan bat they believe obscures the sun.  Californians are
buying glasses safe for eclipse viewing and many are planning trips to
planetariums for a better view of the longest-lasting solar eclipse
until the year 2132.  Many plan to fly to Mexico or Hawaii where the
eclipse will be total.
