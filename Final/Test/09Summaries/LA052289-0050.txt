Last summer's spectacular fire season scorched nearly 1 million of
Yellowstone's 2.2 million acres. The firefighting effort was the
greatest in history, costing $120 million and involving 25,000
firefighters. In July, the Interior Department suspended its
"let-burn" policy, under which lightning-triggered blazes are allowed
to burn unless threatening human lives or property. Ecologists argue
vital wildfires clear away fallen lower branches of lodgepole pines
and overgrowth. The media erroneously suggested a national treasure
was destroyed. Flames fanned by record drought and gale-force winds
were stopped by one-quarter inch of rain and snow on
Sept. 11th. Similar but less frequent fires occurred in the
1700s.
