As Washington state prepares to vote on term limits for its
congressional delegation, the question of constitutionality arises.

Many in opposition say limits are unconstitutional: the only
eligibility requirements are age, citizenship and residency.  However,
proponents argue term limits do not prevent one from serving in
Congress, only put a limit on consecutive terms, adding that further
qualifications have been struck down by the courts.

Term limits will be argued next month by the Florida Supreme Court;
California's court has already ruled the new limits on state
officials' terms constitutional.

Should term limits pass, one option might be the "write-in"
vote.
