Clarence Thomas would be a very different justice than Thurgood
Marshall.  Thomas' departure from civil rights orthodoxy on quotas and
government handouts impressed the Reagan administration, and Thomas is
a great admirer of Reagan and Robert Bork.  Thomas now sits on the
Court of Appeals and before that was chairman of the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission for eight years.  Thomas believes that there is
a difference between the role of a judge and that of a policy maker.
Thomas had battled with the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights.  He
made an enemy of the AARP who said that as EEOC chairman, Thomas let
legal protections for the elderly lapse.
