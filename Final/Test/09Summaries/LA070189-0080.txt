Firefighters got the upper hand Friday on brush fires in the Cleveland
National Forest near Lake Elsinore and in the rugged terrain of the
Antelope Valley.  The Lake Elsinore fire appeared to be caused by
people near a roadside store across the Orange County line.
Firefighters along the Orange-Riverside County line are battling
lingering flames inside the rugged San Mateo Wilderness.  The Antelope
Valley fire was contained 100% but it claimed 2,250 acres along the
outskirts of Elizabeth Lake and Green Valley.  Six structures were
burned, including one home, and more than 300 firefighters battled the
blaze for three days.
