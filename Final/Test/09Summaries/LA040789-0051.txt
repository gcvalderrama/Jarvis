Thursday, Alaska Governor Cowper threatened to close the trans-Alaska
pipeline unless oil companies using the pipeline improve safety
measures and cleanup planning.  This closure would worsen supply
problems in the United States and hurt Alaska, which gets 85% of its
revenue from oil.  Exxon said the third mate turned the autopilot off
before the Valdez ran aground.  The oil spill made it to Kenai Fjords
National Park on Thursday.  The Valdez captain was released on bail in
New York and ordered to appear on May 5 for a hearing on extradition
to Alaska, where he is charged with three misdemeanors.
