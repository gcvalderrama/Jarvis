The World Bank has made poverty alleviation the bank's central mission
in the 1990's, according to an operational directive to staff issued
today.  The bank will link loan volume to the country's efforts to
fight poverty.  Poverty assessments should be available for most
developing countries within two years.  The bank, reacting to evidence
that poverty will rise during the 1990's, will attempt to impose a
form of "social conditionality" on borrowing countries.  Governments
with stronger commitment to poverty reduction will get greater
support.  Past bank efforts focused on improving economic efficiency
with structural adjustment lending.
