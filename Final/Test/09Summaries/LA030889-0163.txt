Canadian coach Charlie Francis has claimed that a mysterious person may have slipped a 
banned steroid into sprinter Ben Johnson's beverage in the drug-testing area before the 
urine test at the Seoul Olympics. But according to acquaintance Lynda Huey, Francis 
bragged about Johnson's preparations for a showdown against US sprinter Carl Lewis. 
Francis allegedly said, "Ben's more afraid of failing the drug test than he is of Carl 
Lewis." Francis has been in Toronto testifying at a Canadian inquiry into drug use in 
sports and said Johnson was clean at the Olympics, that he was not taking the steroid 
Stanozolol before the Games.
