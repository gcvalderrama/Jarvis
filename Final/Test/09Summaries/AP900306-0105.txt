The Senate confirmed Clarence Thomas as a Judge on the US Circuit
Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia on a voice vote brushing
aside complaints from some liberal and senior citizens groups.  Thomas
was one of the most visible Blacks in the Reagan and Bush
Administrations as Chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission.  He was a critic of quotas and affirmative action.  He was
praised by conservatives and criticized by liberals.  Senator Pryor,
Chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, complained that the
statute of limitations on 15,000 age discrimination cases ran out
while Thomas was EEOC Chairman.
