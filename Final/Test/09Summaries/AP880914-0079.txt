Hurricane Gilbert is barrelling through the Carribbean today,
threatening islanders with winds of 175 miles per hour and a barometer
reading of 26.13, the lowest ever recorded in the western hemisphere.

Bob Sheets, the newly appointed head of the National Hurricane Center
at Coral Gables, stays calm, giving press interviews, making forecasts
and writing advisories.

Gilbert qualifies as a Category 5 hurricane: winds higher than 155
miles per hour and a pressure under 27.17 inches.  It has been
compared to the Labor Day, 1935 hurricane in the Florida Keys, which
killed 408, and Camille, which struck Mississippi in 1969, killing
256.
