The magnitude 6.9 earthquake which struck 75 miles south of San
Francisco occurred in a region targeted by seismologists as having the
highest probability of a strong quake in Northern California.  The US
Geologic Survey last year gave a 30% chance for a strong quake in the
Santa Cruz mountains by the year 2018.  Initial reports indicated
widespread damage to highways and old masonry buildings.  The USGS
says the highest probability for a California earthquake of high
magnitude is in the town of Parkfield, where they give a 90% chance
for a magnitude 6 earthquake by the year 2018.
