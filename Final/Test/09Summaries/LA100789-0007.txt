A letter to the LA Times begins by asserting it is not an argument
regarding the merits of gun control laws.  The Second Amendment, as
with the total bill of Rights, was insisted on by some of the states
as protection from the federal government.  Subsequent court cases
have been consistent with the view that the Second Amendment did not
create a federally protected right of individuals but was a limitation
on the national government.  There is no national document controlling
the states with regard to arms.  The states may regulate arms.
