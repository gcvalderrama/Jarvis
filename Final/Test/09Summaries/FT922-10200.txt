In the past, they said that Daryl Gates was the chief of one of the
most brutal and racist police forces in the nation.  In May 1992 he
stands accused of encouraging the violence of rioting and allowing his
police force to do nothing to stop it.  In short, his force was
overwhelmed.  During his tenure, his police force has become
aggressive and insensitive.  It is completely alienated from the
community.  A recent review panel recommended his removal and the
institution of foot patrols as well as the investigation of police
complaints.

Gates has agreed to step down in June 1992.
