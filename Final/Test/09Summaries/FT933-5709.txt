William Daley is the administration's point man on the North American
Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) fight.  Daley, brother of the current
mayor of Chicago and son of the legendary mayor, is a smooth behind
the scene operator with ties in organized labor and Washington.  He
ran Clinton's campaign in Illinois.  Polls show 66% of Americans do
not support the agreement, which must be ratified by January 1 or
disappear.  Core democratic constituencies as well as Ross Perot
oppose NAFTA.  Ratification in Congress requires 218 votes.  Now the
administration can count on 125 republicans and 20 democrats.  Daley
will need to muster 73 more.
