House Speaker Tom Foley spoke out against term limits in Washington
state, asserting that the proposal is supported by right-wing
activists.  Ron Brown, Democratic Chairman, says the idea is an
attempt by Republicans to get rid of those that can't be beaten at the
polls, but a CBS poll shows Americans overwhelmingly favor the limits
with very little demographic variation.

Term limits, it is believed, will open up politics to blacks and
women, among other minorities.

Democratic party officials are dead set against the proposal and
threaten those that support it with blacklisting.

Many governors, other state officials and well known journalists
support limits.
