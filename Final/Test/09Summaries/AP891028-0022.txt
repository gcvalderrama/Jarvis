An earthquake of magnitude 7.2 shook the Solomon Islands today (28
October) the USGS reported.  It was the largest there since 7.4 quake
in 1978.  There were no immediate reports or injury or damage, but
quakes in that area usually don't cause much because it is sparsely
populated and not developed.  No Pacific-wide tsunami was generated by
the quake.  Earlier in the year, an 8.3 quake hit the Macquarie
Islands south of Australia.  A 7 magnitude earthquake is considered
major and is capable of heavy damage.  A magnitude 8 quake is a
"great" quake capable of tremendous damage.
