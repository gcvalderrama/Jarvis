Further study of a newly isolated hormone dubbed "amylin", found in
the pancreases of diabetics may lead to new treatments for the most
common form of the disease.  Amylin appears to be responsible for
obesity, reduced insulin secretion, and thei reduced effectiveness of
insulin observed in Type II diabetes.  Complications from blood sugar
levels rising too high include kidney disease, blindness, and
gangrene.  Researchers hope to develop substances that block amylin's
secretion opening the possibility of treatment.  An authority said the
new work is a "very important finding" if amylin truly blocks insulin
and appears abnormal in diabetics.
