General Accident, the leading British insurer, estimates that its
claims resulting from Hurricane Andrew could be as much as $40M.  It
could reach a level at which external catastrophe reinsurance covers
would become exposed, meaning that GA could pass on its losses to
external reinsurers.  Losses to all insurers could total more than
$8B.  Not all property damaged in the path of Andrew is insured and
estimates for total damage could go to $20B, but some estimates peg
the insurers losses as low as $1B.
