Small, liberal Slovenia plans to work on a constitution that will give
it full sovereignty within a Yugoslav confederation.  The proposal is
to be discussed by their parliament in mid-July, according to
President Milan Kucan.  Its approval is nearly certain.

A majority of Slovenes favor independence, according to a poll.

Yugoslavia's more conservative southern republics, particularly
Serbia, has accused Slovenia of separatist tendencies, which they
oppose; Slovenia, on the other hand, claims Serbia favors more federal
controls and tries to dominate the Yugoslav federation.

Croatia has joined Slovenia in its desire for a looser confederation
of Yugoslav states. Serbia opposes a confederation.
