At 12:30am Wednesday, a US C-5A transport plane took off from Ramstein
AFB in West Germany, clipped the tops of trees then crashed into a
field. 13 were killed. The 20- year old plane, from the 60th Military
Airlift Squadron at Travis AFB in California, was bound for Rhein-Mein
AFB near Frankfurt, carrying supplies and equipment for US troops in
Saudi Arabia. This was the first crash of a C-5 in 15 years.  On April
4, 1975, a C-5B carrying Vietnamese orphans crashed shortly after
takeoff near Saigon, killing 172. Two years ago a collision during an
air show at Ramstein killed 70.
