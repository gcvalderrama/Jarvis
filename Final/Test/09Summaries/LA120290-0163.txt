Amid celebrations, British and French workmen digging the "Chunnel"
between Britain and France, knocked out a passage big enough for a man
to walk through on 1 December 1990.

Tunneling took three years and connects Sangatte, France (near Calais)
and Folkstone, England. Total cost was 16.7 billion dollars. Trains
will be able to cross from Paris to London in 3 1/2 hours.

The link-up actually occurred on 29 October when a 2-inch borer made
an initial connection.

Nine workers were killed during construction.

France looks at the tunnel as an economic boon; the British fear the
import of ills from the Continent.
