Hurricane Gilbert, with winds of 160 miles per hour and a pressure of
26.66, is a category 5 hurricane located in the western Carribbean
heading for the Gulf of Mexico.

It is being closely monitored at the National Hurricane Center.

A category 5 hurricane must have a pressure under 27.17, winds of 160
miles per hour and great potential destructiveness.

Bob Sheets told reporters that Gilbert would be in the top 10 percent
of hurricanes for winds, pressure and potential destructiveness,
comparable to the storm of 1935 in the Florida Keys which killed 600,
and Camille, which struck Mississippi in 1969, killing 256.
