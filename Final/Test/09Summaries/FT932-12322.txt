World Bank president, Lewis Preston, promised yesterday to strengthen
the bank's efforts to reduce poverty, but will not set any targets.
Preston said the bank was making progress.  In 1982 only 5% of
structural adjustment loans had a specific poverty focus, while in
1992 almost 50% did.  The bank will publish annual progress reports
and involve the poor in project design and implementation.  East Asia
has reduced the proportion of people in absolute poverty to 10%, but
in sub-Saharan Africa the proportion has increased to 50%.  Preston
said the concerned governments must cooperate and called for money
from the Group of Seven.
