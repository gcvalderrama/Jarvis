Two huge boring machines are tunneling their way, one from France and
the other from England, to meet 80-130 feet under the English. When
the tunnel is completed, it will be 31 miles long, 24 of it
underwater.
 
The British are hesitant--they like their privacy. They have also
decided not to build a high speed train like the French. This will
slow things down in Britain.

The service tunnel is being built now. Construction of two train
tunnels will follow in December of 1988. The "Chunnel", between
Folkstone and Calais, will be completed in 1993.
