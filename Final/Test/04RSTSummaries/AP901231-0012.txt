Mexico , 
is banking on the clouds 
where sun worship has passed from ancient civilizations to modern beachgoers , is gearing up early for the day next year 
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has appointed a Cabinet-level commission 
to roll in the country's financial favor 
The commission bills the northwestern state of Baja California Sur as the best place 
because the state has an average of 300 cloudless days a year 
Baja California Sur alone plans to spend $ 26.5 million 
for public safety for eclipse enthusiasts but banks on raking in millions more from tourism 
when the sun will be blotted out
