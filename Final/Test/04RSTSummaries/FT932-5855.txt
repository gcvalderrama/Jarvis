KEY Hispanic groups in the US are making stringent side agreements , 
aimed at protecting worker rights and the environment , a condition of their support for the North American Trade Agreement between the US , Canada and Mexico 
last week that the Clinton administration also had 
to present a blueprint of a plan 
before displaced workers would give displaced workers support 
The announcement will deal a blow to supporters of Nafta , who counted on Hispanic backing 
But the US Hispanic community is deeply divided 
over whether to endorse the agreement 
Leaders of important Hispanic coalitions such as La Raza , a civil rights group , and the Southwest Voter Registration Project feared Hispanics in the US would bear the brunt of the negative impact of Nafta
