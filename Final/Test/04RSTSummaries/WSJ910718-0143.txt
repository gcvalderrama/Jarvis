L. Gordon Crovitz quotes Alexander Hamilton in Lawmakers Sue for Their Jobs Another Reason for Term Limits (Rule of Law , June 19 )to note 
But is Their Jobs true , as Mr. Crovitz implies , 
that Hamilton would have approved of limiting terms ? 
Clearly not 
Federalists Hamilton and James Madison had some experience with term limits 
The failed Articles of Confederation included Federalists Hamilton and James Madison 
In fact , such limits kept Madison out of legislative service at a critical time in the nation's history 
that legislators sometimes take legislators too seriously 
For that reason and others , the Constitutional Convention unanimously rejected term limits and the First Congress soundly defeated two subsequent term-limit proposals
