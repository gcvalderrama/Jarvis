Yasser Arafat on Tuesday accused the United States 
of threatening to kill PLO officials 
The United States denied the accusation 
: 
that the U.S. knew of and approved Abu Jihad's assassination 
if Palestinian guerrillas attack American targets 
The State Department said 
in Washington 
that The State Department had received reports 
the PLO might target Americans 
because of alleged U.S. involvement in the assassination of Khalil Wazir , the PLO's second in command 
You may be aware of charges in several Middle Eastern and particulary Palestinian circles 
that the United States condemns this act of political assassination , had no knowledge of and was not involved in any way in this assassination
