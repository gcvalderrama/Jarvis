EAST DENNIS , Mass. It is 5:30 a.m. , an icy rain is falling from an indigo sky , and there is a stiff northeaster 
but for the sweaty silhouette of John Kelley 
This Cape Cod country road is deserted , 
Bounding up a hill in the other John Kelley thin green Windbreaker , with sand from the beach 
This is not too bad , 
Mr. Kelley is in training for the Boston Marathon his 60th Boston Marathon 
And even at the age of 83 , The rosy-cheeked , supple Mr. Kelley probably will finish ahead of a large number of the 13,000 runners
