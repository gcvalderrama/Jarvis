A colossal tunneling machine is boring beneath the English Channel from the white cliffs of Dover , pursuing a dream 
born in Napoleon's time 
Another is digging from the French coast in what the tunnel builders call the largest civil engineering project now under way in the world 
that is coming true at last 
The 31-mile tunnel , 24 miles of it underwater , will cut the London-Paris journey from six hours to three , as fast as a scheduled airline 
The 31-mile tunnel will enable freight 
to travel on one train 
instead of being shifted to trucks for a cross-channel ferry trip subject
