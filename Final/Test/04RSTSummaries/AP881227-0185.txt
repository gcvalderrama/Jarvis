who started Shining Path guerrillas bloody uprising in the mountains eight years ago , are moving into the shantytowns 
Abimael Guzman , founder of the rebel movement , has said 
of the slums and Shining Path guerrillas people : 
that encircle the capital like a noose 
The immense masses of the shantytowns are like belts of steel that lock in the enemy 
and hold back the enemy reactionary forces 
His Maoist rebels , once secretive fanatics , are becoming a political force 
that seeks public support in Huaycan and the other makeshift communities where two-thirds of Lima's 7 million people scrape along
