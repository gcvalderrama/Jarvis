the destructive path Hurricane Hugo would follow , giving people plenty of time 
But hurricane tracking remains an uncertain science 
Thomas Pyke , head of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's satellite service 
Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center used computer models 
All the world's knowledge about meteorological conditions and forecasting changes in those conditions is embodied in those models , said 
to track Hugo's path into Charleston , S.C. 
to flee the South Carolina coast 
that the landfall was predicted in time for evacuation
