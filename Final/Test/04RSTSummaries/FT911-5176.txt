Sir , Mr James Skinner (Letters , April 11 )charges me with misuse of statistics 
and understanding the debt burden of poor countries 
I do not know what Mr Skinner has in mind 
in referring to institutions 
and by clear implication 
inflict suffering on the poor 
What I do know is that throughout Asia , Africa and Latin America the level of material achievement declines 
as we move away 
from the effect of western commerce 
To harp on alleged external causes of Third World poverty diverts attention 
from the real factors behind this poverty 
James Skinner cites Africa 
serving only western interests ,
