THE POLITICS of international trade can be devilishly complicated 
just try 
explaining what GATT , the Uruguay Round or Blair House are all 
about - but US investors have adopted a sensibly direct approach to the North American Free Trade Agreement : 
for US companies , good for the stock markets , and good for President Clinton 
US investors reasoning is quite simple 
that Nafta will lift corporate profits 
if Congress passes the treaty next week , Congress will be good for the economy , good 
because in a more open trading environment between the three signatory countries the US , with a more open trading environment between the three signatory countries superior industrial productivity rates and better-quality products , will enjoy the greatest economic benefits
