Lawmakers clashed Thursday over the question 
of counting illegal aliens in the 1990 Census , 
whether following the letter of the Constitution results in a system 
debating 
that is unfair to citizens 
The forum was a Census subcommittee hearing on bills 
which would require the Census Bureau 
Rep. Thomas J. Ridge , R-Pa. , 
whether people are in the country legally and , if not , to delete them from the counts 
This is a fairness issue , said 
to figure 
out 
unfairly when people large population totals give then extra seats in the House 
used in reapportioning seats in the House of Representatives
