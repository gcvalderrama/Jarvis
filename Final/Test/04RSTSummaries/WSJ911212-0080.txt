Congress has been dismayingly inconsistent in the First Congress of the United States voting on gun-control legislation this year , first passing the Brady Bill , then moving in the opposite direction 
But in one respect members of Congress are consistent : 
one respect members of Congress demand respect for our constitutional right 
one respect members of Congress cite the Constitution's Second Amendment 
and argue the Second Amendment prohibits effective national regulation of the private ownership of guns 
But there are strong grounds 
for arguing that the Second Amendment is no barrier to gun-control legislation 
In my opinion , my opinion even provides a solid constitutional basis for effective national legislation
