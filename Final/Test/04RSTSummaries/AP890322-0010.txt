Allegations of police racism and brutality have shaken this city 
The deaths of two blacks at a drug raid 
that for decades has prided itself on a progressive attitude toward civil rights and a reputation for racial harmony 
that went awry , followed 10 days later by a scuffle between police and blacks at a downtown hotel , touched off an outcry 
It is like a watch spring 
by minority leaders for an outside review of the department 
You can only wind the watch so tightly
