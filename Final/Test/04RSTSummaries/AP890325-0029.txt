The calm waters of Prince William Sound have stymied efforts 
in U.S. history 
, 
which spewed from a ship 
trying to avoid chunks of ice , officials said 
to disperse the largest oil spill 
that ran aground 
The spill of some 270,000 barrels _ or 11.3 million gallons _ occurred early Friday 
when the 987-foot tanker Exxon Valdez went hard aground on Bligh Reef , about 25 miles outside Valdez , the northermost ice-free port in the United States 
the use of chemicals 
to disperse and sink the heavy North Slope crude oil failed 
because the agents depend in part on rough seas
