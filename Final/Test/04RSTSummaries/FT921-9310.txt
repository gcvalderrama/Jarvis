THE CONDITION known in cattle as mad cow disease , spongiform encephalopathies , has been found in Britain's sparsely-scattered antelope population , the government has admitted 
Three elands , three greater kudu and an arabian oryx have been diagnosed with the disease over the past three years 
In all , six species other 
with the condition during this period 
than cattle have been confirmed 
The statistics 
in response to a written question from Mr Ron Davies , a Labour agriculture spokesman 
- released 
- show a disconcertingly rapid increase in the number of sheep 
to have the disease 
found 
A total of 894 cases of sheep encephalopathies or scrapie were diagnosed in 1991 , versus just 348 a year-earlier
