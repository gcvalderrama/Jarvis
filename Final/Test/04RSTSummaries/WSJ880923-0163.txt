Wearing a bright yellow flame-retardant shirt , Donald Despain crouches down 
The scorched hillside around him appears utterly lifeless 
Almost everything in sight is black , from the tips of trees 40 feet above the ground to the powdered ash blanketing the earth 
to study the ash-covered forest floor 
The firestorm 
that raged through here in recent weeks was driven by 60-mile-an-hour winds 
The fire was so intense 
that fanned temperatures to more than 1,600 degrees Fahrenheit 
that a gray shadow on the forest floor is all that remains of a fallen log 
Where many people recoil at the sweep of nature's destructive power , the 47-year-old Mr. Despain marvels at the tiny steps life is already taking to renew the sweep of nature's destructive power
