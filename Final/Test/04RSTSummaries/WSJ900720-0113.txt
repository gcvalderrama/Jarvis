LIMA On June 4 , I was among a group of journalists 
Lucky punches sometimes win wars , and maybe this was the case 
Is the Shining Path 
And finally , who is actually winning the war ? 
There are no easy answers 
There is not much of a dispute on the basic data , however 
who were told that the war against the Shining Path (Sendero Luminoso )guerrillas had almost been won 
We had been allowed into a safe house 
getting stronger or weaker making progress or losing ground among the population ? 
The Shining Path went to war in 1980 , on the same day Peru was holding general elections
