Since Mr Ruiz Massieu's assassination , there has been renewed speculation 
Mr Carlos Fuentes , the novelist , asked yesterday in a newspaper article 
whether Mexico , like Colombia , was facing a period of sustained political violence orchestrated by drug barons 
If Mr Ernesto Zedillo , Mexico's next president , had any doubts about the difficulties 
that political reactionaries and drug traffickers may have had a hand in the killing six months ago of Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio , the ruling party's reform-minded presidential candidate , 
entitled 
that more groups than currently revealed might be involved in Mr Ruiz Massieu's murder
