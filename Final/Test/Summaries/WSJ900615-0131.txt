Britain is moving ahead toward the completion of the "Chunnel" with
France. It has, however, refused to fund a high speed train (TGV) for
southern Britain. The "Chunnel", amid cost overruns, is set to open in
1993.

Britain has already funded billions for new roads, and passenger and
freight services but these are still inadequate for a TGV link. Those
against a TGV link believe the real money will be in freight haulage
by truck from London to the tunnel.

The trip from London to Paris via the Chunnel will take about three
hours. There will not be any profit from it until the end of the
century.

France is going ahead with a high-speed train (TGV) link but the
British population does not want the annoyance of a TGV.
