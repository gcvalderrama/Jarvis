Elizabeth Taylor's physician says she has rallied from pneumonia and
is out of danger and off the ventilator.  Dr. Bernard Weintraub said,
however, she is still in serious condition and remains in intensive
care.

A large crowd of reporters, cameramen and employees gathered at the
hospital to get news of Miss Taylor.
  
Taylor's health problems began with a fall from a horse in 1945, and
she suffered a near- fatal bout of pneumonia in 1961, requiring a
tracheotomy.

Her other health problems included addiction to pain-killers and
sleeping pills.  Her doctor denies she has either cancer or
AIDS.
