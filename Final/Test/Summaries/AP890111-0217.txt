Authorities questioned the injured pilot of a Boeing 737 which crashed
short of the runway at East Midlands Airport in England, but revealed
no clues as to why the jet's undamaged right engine was shut down
while the other engine burned.  The government ordered checks of
engine monitoring systems, prompting speculation that a malfunctioning
alarm system could have misled the crew.  The plane's CFM56 engines
have parts manufactured by a General Electric Company, which may have
falsified its test records.  Boeing said aircraft that use the engine
are being inspected, but it does not imply a cause has been
identified.
