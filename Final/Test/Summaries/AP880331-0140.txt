In Texas an average of 118 tornadoes occur annually, most in April
through June, with an average of 36 in May. A tornado watch means
weather conditions are suitable for tornado development. A warning
means one has already developed. At home, take cover underground or in
a central closet or bathroom, or lie under a heavy table. Opening
windows to equalize air pressure is not necessary. Leave your car or
mobile home and get into the nearest ditch. Don't try to outrun a
twister in your car.  Most fatalities are from flying debris so keep a
low profile and cover your head.
