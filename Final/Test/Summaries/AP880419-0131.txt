A tornado hit the North Florida town of Madison at 4:30am today,
killing four people and injuring 15. Two deaths occurred when mobile
homes blew apart. The tornado touched down in front of a shopping
center and proceeded straight into North Florida Junior College,
totaling the new library and taking the roof off the auditorium. In
under 30 minutes it cut a 12-mile swath of destruction. The tornado
was spawned by a belt of thunderstorms being pushed by a cold
front. High winds, heavy rain, lightning, and hail occurred across the
southeast. Two other tornadoes struck 100 miles west.
