The House will not exclude illegal aliens from the census numbers used
for reapportionment.  In related action, it voted to include overseas
military personnel.  The Commerce Department will work with the
Defense Department to count these people.  Rep. Tom Ridge, R-Pa.,
unsuccessfully sought to attach a ban on counting illegal aliens to an
appropriations bill that provided funding to the State, Justice and
Commerce Departments.  Census officials oppose any attempt to delete
illegal aliens, contending they cannot accurately determine who is in
this category.  Furthermore, it may cause people to lie or refuse to
participate in the count, thus complicating the census'
accuracy.
