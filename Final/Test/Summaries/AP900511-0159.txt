Elizabeth Taylor's doctors reported today that she will require about
six more weeks hospitalization due to bacterial pneumonia and a yeast
infection, requiring intravenous therapy for about a month.

She is reportedly out of intensive care and tolerating therapy well.
She previously had viral pneumonia and came close to death last month.

Bacterial pneumonia is responsive to antibiotics, unlike viral
pneumonia.

The present problems began with a sinus infection on April 9 with
admission to Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital; worsening, she was
transferred to St. John's.

Miss Taylor is in a suite at St. John's.  Visitors included her four
children and Michael Jackson.
