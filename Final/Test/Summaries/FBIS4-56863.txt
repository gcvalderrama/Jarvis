Shining Path leaders under arrest have said the "peoples war" has
ended but those not under arrest, led by "Comrade Feliciano", believe
it must continue.  Feliciano's group must plan to rescue Abimael
Guzman, Shining Paths founder, "dead or alive" at any cost.  A five
point document emerged from Feliciano's group which reemphasized
positions from earlier Central Committee Plenums and also to determine
sanctions for those contributing to the arrest of Guzman.  Guzman and
those who support holding talks with the Administration denounced the
reports of the Feliciano group to go on with the war.
