Serbia cut political and economic ties with Slovenia Friday, prompting
Slovenia to charge that Serbia is attempting to "oust us from
Yugoslavia."

Earlier, police had dispersed a pro-Serbian rally in Ljubljana,
Slovenia's capital, after Slovenia banned the event.  Serbia's break
with Slovenia was in reaction to that dispersal.

Slovenia's collective presidency protested to Serbia, asserting the
rally was an attempt to unseat their leaders.

The clash demonstrates major ideological differences: Slovenia
recognizes opposition groups, while Serbia permits only the Communist
Party.

Serbia calls on Yugoslavia's Slovenian president to resign, while
Delo, the major newspaper in Ljubljana, called the action a
"declaration of war."
