Mad cow disease or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), first
diagnosed in 1986, eats holes in the brains of its victims and is
similar to scrapie, a sheep disease in Britain since the 1700's.  BSE
is believed to have been transmitted through cattle feed containing
sheep by-products.  More than 10,000 cattle in Britain and Ireland
have been destroyed.  The U.S. and six other nations have banned
imports of cattle, embryos and semen from Britain, and the European
Community has proposed a ban on exports of most British cattle.
British agriculture officials insist transmission to humans is
remote.
