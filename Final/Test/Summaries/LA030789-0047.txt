Carl Lewis said Ben Johnson demonstrated he was taking performance-enhancing drugs 
at the Seoul Olympics by coming out of the blocks for the 100-meter final like a caged 
lion after running preliminary heats. Johnson's gold medal and Seoul world-record time 
were both revoked when his drug test was positive for the banned anabolic steroid 
Stanozolol. Supposedly, an unidentified man seen talking with Lewis sabotaged the beer 
provided to facilitate urine samples. Johnson's world record of 9.83 seconds at the 1987 
World Championships at Rome stands because he passed a drug test after that race. 
Johnson took the steroid Furazabol three weeks before the Olympics.
