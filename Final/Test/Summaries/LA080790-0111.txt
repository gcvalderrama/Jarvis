On 15 March 1988, a narcotics agent and a policeman at Los Angeles
Airport were searching for the companion of a black drug courier
suspect.  When Clayton Searle, the policeman, saw a black man that he
thought would fit this description, he moved forward to question him.
The two men became embroiled in a fight and Searle handcuffed him.

Later, Searle realized that he had falsely arrested Joe Morgan,
retired star infielder of the Cincinnati Reds.

By 7 August, 1990, Morgan was preparing to sue Searle and the City of
Los Angeles for being targeted as a black and for police
profiling.
