The U.S. Senate, possibly unconstitutionally, voted to exclude illegal
aliens from the 1990 census.  Although some state officials are
worried about the bills effect on federal aid and apportionment, many
are unsure of its possible impact.  California is thought to have at
least half of the nation's estimated 3 to 8 million illegal aliens.
Officials there fear loss of both federal aid and a House seat or two
if illegal aliens are not counted.  New York and Illinois, two other
high alien states, may help to defeat the bill in the House.  The bill
is part of an overhaul of our immigration laws.
