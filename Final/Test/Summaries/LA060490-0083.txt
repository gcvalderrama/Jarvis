"Mad cow" disease is threatening the $3.7 billion British beef
industry.  France and now West Germany have banned imports, citing
concern that the disease could be transmitted to humans.  In 1989,
France bought $264 million worth of Britain's beef exports; West
Germany $50 million worth.  The U.S. does not import British beef and
recently banned importation of live cattle.  Despite government
assurances that beef is safe, sales in Britain also have dropped, with
one quarter of the people no longer eating beef.  The disease has been
responsible for the death of 14,000 cattle and, recently, a Siamese
cat died of an identical disease.
