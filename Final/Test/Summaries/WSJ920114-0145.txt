Several correspondents disagreed with Richard Goldwin's article on gun
control.  One writer from the CATO Institute argues that Goldwin erred
in confusing actual service in a militia as a necessary condition to
bear arms.  Another, that the militia is not the National Guard so
Goldwin's contention that arms bearers should join the Guard would not
apply to gun ownership.  Still another sees private gun ownership as
"our only sure defense".  One writer believes that Goldwin's agenda is
to remove all guns from American citizens through total regulations.
But, not all of these writers are against "sensible" gun
control.
