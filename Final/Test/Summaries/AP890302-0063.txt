Drug abusers infected with the AIDS virus should be treated to prevent
TB according to the New England Journal of Medicine.  TB has increased
among people at high risk of AIDS.

The study shows that the TB comes from a lingering infection in a
person whose immune system is weakened by HIV.

People can carry either AIDS or TB for years; most with HIV go on to
develop the syndrome, while only about 10% of TB carriers develop the
disease.  Those with AIDS are more likely to develop TB and infect
others.
