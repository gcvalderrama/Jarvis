Slovenia's Information Ministry confirmed today that federal military
commanders met in March to consider ways to deal with Slovenian
dissidents.  The military blamed the dissent on a foreign-backed
conspiracy.  Slovenia's police and Communist Party disagree.

Army commanders have been increasingly critical of Slovenia's leaders,
urging them to act firmly against political dissidents.

Mladina, the Socialist Youth Organization's publication, wrote
Slovenia's Communist Party that the army planned to arrest dissidents
and use force in any resulting protest. They added that the civilian
government was not notified of the army's intentions.

The plan, blocked by Slovenia's president, was denied by the
military.
