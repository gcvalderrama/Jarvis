A Pan Am Boeing 747 apparently exploded in the air 54 minutes after
takeoff from London's Heathrow Airport.  The wreckage scattered bodies
and debris over 10 miles of countryside and ravaged the village of
Lockerbie, Scotland.  All 259 people aboard the plan and 22 on the
ground were killed.  Sabotage is believed to be the most likely
explanation for the crash.  An anonymous caller to the AP office in
London claimed responsibility for the crash saying it was retaliation
by the "Guardians of the Islamic Revolution" for the downing of an
Iran Air Airbus by a US cruiser in July.
