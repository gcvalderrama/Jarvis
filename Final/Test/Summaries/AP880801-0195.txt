Forest officials for Missouri's Mark Twain Forest believe the problem
of arson is often rooted in some regional traditions.  A
psychologist's study found economic and even aesthetic reasons why
some people start forest fires.  The tradition stretches across the
southern United States.  Accordingly, in the springtime, people used
to burn the woods to allow grass to grow.  A policy of open grazing on
any open land was allowed in the Ozarks into the 1960s.  Subsistence
farmers claimed fire helped control ticks, snakes, disease, and
encroachment of trees on to grazing land.

Some people enjoyed the smell of smoke in the spring air.
