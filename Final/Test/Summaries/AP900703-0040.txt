Lawmakers who replaced Communists in Slovenia's parliament proclaimed
its sovereignty yesterday without, however, calling for secession.

Their declaration provides for an independent legal system and
Slovenian control over armed forces stationed there.  The document
also mandates a new democratic constitution within a year.

The legislature unanimously voted for the declaration.

Slovenia, with a population of two million, defeated the Communists in
a free election last month, the first in 45 years.

Slovenia's leaders favor joining the European Community with or
without Yugoslavia's permission; Croatia, with its new right-center
government, echoes the demand.

Serbia's hard-line government strongly opposes the plan for
confederation.
