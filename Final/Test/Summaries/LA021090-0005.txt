Columnist Michael Kinsley notes a recent poll that shows even a
majority of gun owners favor a waiting period for handgun purchases
and the registration of semi-automatic weapons and handguns.  He also
cites an article by Don Kates on the Second Amendment which expounds
on the "militia" and the "right of the people".  At the time of the
Bill of Rights, all able-bodied men were considered part of the
militia.  Today, an individual's weapons should be light enough to
carry ("bear").  He sees no Constitutional restrictions to mandatory
registration or laws against concealed weapons in public.
