Hurricane Hugo provided a strong warning to the public.  Because it
struck a sparsely populated area in South Carolina with adequate
warning, 350,000 persons were evacuated safely.  In a denser area,
Hugo would have caused damage greater than Americans have ever seen.
Hugo was the worst hurricane in the southeast United States since
1965.

The National Hurricane Center uses a computer simulation called SLOSH,
which predicts the size of the storm surge and amount of damage.

William Gray, of Colorado State University, finds a correlation
between rainfall in Africa and Florida hurricanes.  Drought in Africa
reduces the number; a normal rainfall correlates with more
hurricanes.
