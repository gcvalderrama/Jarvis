Elizabeth Taylor, who is seriously ill with pneumonia at St. John's
Hospital, underwent a lung biopsy Monday to determine the pneumonia's
cause.  She is now stabilizing in the intensive care unit, her
breathing assisted by a ventilator.

She was hospitalized at Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital on April 9 with
a sinus infection, and moved to St. John's April 16 after developing
pneumonia.

Miss Taylor, who won Oscars for "Butterfield 8" and "Who's Afraid of
Virginia Woolf?"  has had back problems since a fall from a horse in
1945.  She has acknowledged addictions to pain and sleeping pills and
treatment for alcohol and drug abuse.
