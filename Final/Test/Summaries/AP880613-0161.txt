Osman Morote, top military leader of the Shining Path and considered
to be number 2 to founder Abimael Guzman, was captured by police.  The
Maoist group is said to have killed more than 10,000 in guerrilla
operations in Peru in the last eight years.  Recent reports of a
growing rivalry between Guzman and Morote leading to speculations that
Guzman betrayed Morote.  Shining Path leaders have gone underground
and Guzman has not been seen for years leading to rumors that he may
have died.  But most believe him to be alive and moving about in
various disguises.
