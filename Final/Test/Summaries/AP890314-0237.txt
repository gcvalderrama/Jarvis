Twelve million Americans have some form of diabetes but it is most
prevalent among minorities, especially Native Americans, blacks and
Hispanics.  Hispanics are three times as likely to develop diabetes
than the general population.  More than 150,000 Americans die from
diabetes each year; another 150,000 deaths are diabetes related.  No
one knows what sparks it but researchers believe Hispanics could hold
the key.  The most common form develops mostly in obese adults over 40
who may have a family history of the disease.  Family studies of
diabetic patients are bringing researchers closer to finding the gene
that triggers the disease.
