The drought of 1988 hit hardest in the upper Midwest with more relief
aid ($100 million) going to North Dakota than any other state.  North
Dakota, the nation's most agriculturally dependent state and the
number one producer of hard-red spring wheat, lost two-thirds of its
1988 crop.  The $3.9 billion relief aid, due to lax rules outside the
Midwest, led to thousands of farmers collecting millions of dollars
for normal trials of nature.  However, money did reach areas Congress
most intended to aid, including North Dakota, where it kept some
farmers on their land and may have prevented some business
closures.
