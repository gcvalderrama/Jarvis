TB, until recently declining, has made a comeback.  Health officials
are alarmed by a 35% increase last year in Newark, New Jersey.
Nationwide a five percent increase is attributed to the AIDS virus,
which destroys the body's immune system.

International health officials meeting in Boston last week, alarmed by
the increase in the United States and the epidemic in Africa, urged
doctors and clinics to screen for and treat tuberculosis, especially
in AIDS patients.

Although 10 to 15 million Americans have contracted the TB bacterium,
few will develop the disease; however, a person with a compromised
immune system, such as with AIDS, cancer or poor nutrition may develop
tuberculosis.
