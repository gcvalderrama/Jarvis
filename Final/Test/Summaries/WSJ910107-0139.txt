Researchers may be close to finding the molecular culprits behind
spongiform encephalopathy.  Scrapies is the form of the disease in
sheep and was transferred to cattle in the 1980s as the "mad cow
disease", and apparently to 11 British cats.  The human form is
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is rare but has appeared in clusters
among sheep growers in Slovakia, New Guinean cannibal tribesmen, and
those carrying a newly identified genetic defect found in some eastern
Europeans.  Researchers believe the brains of the victims are
gummed-up by an altered brain protein, called a prion, that replicates
itself without genetic material.
