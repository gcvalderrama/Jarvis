The Agriculture Department confirmed Thursday that a deadening drought
will curtail the Fall corn harvest by a third or more, resulting in
higher retail food prices for months and years to come.  However, crop
stockpiles are so high that the US need not fear shortages on grocery
shelves or discontinuance of food exporting.  Also, President Reagan
has signed a $3.9 billion relief bill that will help farmers to
survive to plant again next Spring.  Compared to 1987, corn production
is down 34%, soybeans 23%, wheat 1%, oats 45%, barley 45%, sorghum
24%. The consumer food price index could go up 2%.
