An Op-Ed item by Michael Gartner drew fire from three readers but some
support from another who identified himself as a life member of the
NRA.  One of those at odds with Gartner says the issue is crime
control and not gun control; that criminals don't care about
gun-control laws.  Another reader accuses Gartner of wanting to
eliminate handguns from our society.  One reader from California
believes the "individual right to keep and bear arms is our ultimate
defense against tyranny".  The one supporting position believes that
it is not too much to ask for a seven day "cooling-off" period as in
the Brady Bill.
