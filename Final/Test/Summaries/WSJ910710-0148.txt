A report by a commission headed by former Deputy Secretary of State
Warren Christopher on the Los Angeles Police Department was issued on
9 July, 1991.  The report, prompted by the videotaped beating of
Rodney King, describes a department riddled by brutality and racism.
It calls for the resignation of its chief, Daryl Gates.

Other highlights of the report include the following:

a. A chief should be limited to two 5-year terms.  b. Departmental
training promotes a siege mentality.  c. A code of silence exists in
regard to community complaints.  d. There is a pattern of acceptance
of officers who violate rules of excessive force.
