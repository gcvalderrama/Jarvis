Hispanics, whose incidence of diabetes is two to three times as high
as the US population as a whole, can learn how to manage illness at a
free hospital clinic and/or in neighborhood programs in the Morgan
Hill area of San Jose, California.  The clinic will focus on three
ways to manage diabetes: diet, exercise, and medication.  Participants
will learn that traditional dishes can be just as tasty, but
healthier, when made with unsaturated fats and that exercise will
reduce weight, which in turn will lower the risk of contracting
diabetes.  The programs are aimed at people who only speak or prefer
Spanish.
