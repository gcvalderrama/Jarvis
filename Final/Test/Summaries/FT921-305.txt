Slovenian economic prospects would brighten if it could settle its
relations with the National Bank of Yugoslavia (NBY), establish
relations with foreign creditors and join the IMF and World Bank.

Foreign exchange deposits by Slovenians and Croatians before
independence and transferred to NBY, have been frozen.  Slovenia's
largest bank, where funds were originally deposited, is urging
negotiation for their return but estimate it will take years.
Slovenes are also anxious to negotiate their share of the national
debt - about 1.8 billion dollars - and are committed to repayment.

Negotiations on economic issues and American recognition could speed
Slovenia's admission to the IMF and other financial
institutions.
