The 1990 hurricane season, which ends today, had more but less
devastating storms than usual, and one forecaster thinks 1991 will be
calmer.

Dr. William Gray of Colorado State University thinks a dry spell in
Africa accounts for the reduction of storms on the eastern seaboard
over the past 20 years.

Normal rainfall in the Sahel may have spawned Gilbert (1988) and Hugo
(1989).  Gray believes an anticipated low Sahel rainfall in 1991 will
make for fewer hurricanes.

The National Hurricane Center's chief, Bob Sheets, predicts higher
hurricane activity in the 90's and early years of the new century.

There were 8 hurricanes this season.
