Richard Goldwin assesses many of the letters he received in response
to his earlier Wall Street Journal column on gun control as
misinterpreting his article and the Second Amendment, and accusing him
of calling for the removal of all guns through regulation, which he
denies.  Goldwin maintains, as does one of his correspondents, that
regulation of gun ownership and use does not violate the constitution.
All letters, Goldwin states, missed his point that gun owners be
required to sign up (not join) with the National Guard.  His main
point was to show how far Congress can go in gun control legislation
without exceeding its Constitutional powers.
