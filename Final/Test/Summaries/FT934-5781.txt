After seven years of trying, the US Congress has passed the Brady
Bill.  Its opponents in Congress had argued that the bill will
inconvenience only law-abiding citizens and not criminals.  They also
see the federal government's poor policing of licensed gun dealers as
a sign that Brady will be ineffective.  Supporters of Brady concede
that it will only make a small dent in the numbers of gun sales.  The
National Rifle Association led opposition to the bill and has gained
membership but they have also been put on the defensive by opponents.
Left-wing Democrats have begun to champion gun control as a supplement
to tough anti-crime measures.
