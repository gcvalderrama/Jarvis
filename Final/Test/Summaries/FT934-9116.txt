The battle of the North American Free Trade Agreement has moved into
the congressional districts for the holiday weekend.  Pro-NAFTA forces
claim victory for Vice-president Gore in his recent debate with Ross
Perot.  Perot is under attack from Mexico for statements he made.  One
poll has popular support rising from 34% to 57%.  Opponents believe
fear of job and investment losses will hold sway and one leader claims
219 votes against the pact. Opposition rallies, marches, and meetings
are planned.  The administration claims 192 votes and is financing a
campaign for voters to send NAFTA support telegrams to their
representatives.
