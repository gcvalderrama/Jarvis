Yesterday President Clinton told the National Governors' Association
that within 10 days he will name a task-force to reform welfare.

His measure will include job training for the unemployed with a
requirement for recipients to work for their check.

President Clinton said that "welfare should be a second chance, not a
way of life."

Since the recession started the number of welfare recipients has grown
by 30 percent.

The president's plan will include continued health coverage, child
care and earned income tax credits for working welfare recipients.

Many states have begun welfare reform programs and Mr. Clinton
encourages such experiments.
