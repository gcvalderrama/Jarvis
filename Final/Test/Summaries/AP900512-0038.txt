Elizabeth Taylor has developed bacterial pneumonia and a yeast
infection after a five-week hospital stay for viral pneumonia.  Her
doctors say she will require six more weeks of hospital treatment and
intravenous therapy to deal with these complications.

They revealed that she was near death on April 22 from the viral
infection.  They explained that bacterial pneumonia often follows
viral pneumonia.  She is improving significantly, they added.
  
Earlier her publicist had reported she would be released soon.

Miss Taylor, a two-time Oscar winner, was admitted to Daniel Freeman
Marina Hospital on April 9th with sinusitis, but transferred to
St. John's after developing pneumonia.
