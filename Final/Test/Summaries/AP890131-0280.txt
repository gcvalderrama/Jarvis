It was announced Tuesday that The Office of Trading is investigating
the anti- competitive practices of South Africa's De Beers Diamond
organization.  The Office of Fair Trading is a watchdog organization.
There have been complaints against De Beers suggesting they have a
monopoly on diamond trading in London. The investigation is looking
into whether there has been an abuse of power.  British mining concern
Consolidated Gold Fields PLC admitted that it filed a complaint.
There is no time limit on The Office of Fair Trading's investigation.
The OFT may also decide to refer the complaint to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission.
