As of 30 October 1990, Britain and France have been linked via a
two-inch probe beneath the English Channel. It completes a dream by
Napolean who wanted to use such a tunnel to defeat Britain.

The goal is to enable passengers to travel between London and Paris
via rail in three hours.

The cost, with considerable overruns, is 16.7 billion dollars. The
so-called "Chunnel" links Shakespeare Cliff near Dover, to Sangatte,
near Calais, France.

The tunnel will open in 1993 and is expected to carry 28 million
passengers in the first year of operation. There will be no profit
until 2000.
