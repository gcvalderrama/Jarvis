More than 40 million people from Hawaii to Central America viewed the
June 11, long lasting eclipse, the likes of which will not be seen for
151 years.  Clouds and fog prevented many from viewing the eclipse in
stages and only experience the eclipse when totally dark.  Many
viewers in Hawaii had an added treat provided by a dazzling eruption
of Mauna Loa at the height of the eclipse. Scores of astronomers and
amateurs turned Hawaii into an eclipse theme park. "Eclipsefests" and
shops selling souvenirs sprang up in many areas in the eclipse
path.
