"Mad cow disease" has been found in Britain's antelope population.
Three elands, three greater kudu, and an Arabian oryx have been
diagnosed with the disease since 1989, according to a British
government report.  The number of sheep with scrapies tripled from 348
cases in 1990 to 894 in 1991.  Since 1989, spongiform encephalopathy
cases were confirmed in 23 cats and 29 goats.  An agricultural
minister stressed that spongiform encephalopathies in species other
than cattle did not have to be reported.  He also said that scrapie
was considered transmissible both "maternally and horizontally."
