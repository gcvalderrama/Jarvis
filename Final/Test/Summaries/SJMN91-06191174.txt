Solar eclipses occur somewhere on earth every six months but, on
average, at any given point only once every 360 years.  Fewer than a
third are total.  Because the moon's orbit is tilted, it crosses the
sun's path twice a year, otherwise an eclipse would occur with each
new moon.  The eclipse to occur on June 11, is of great interest
because of its long duration and wide path encompassing heavily
populated areas.  Eclipse study in 1868 provided evidence of helium
and in 1919, astronomers saw a star at the edge of the sun that should
have been behind the sun, thus confirming an Einstein prediction that
star's gravity can bend light.
