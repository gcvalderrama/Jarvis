Interviews were conducted on the perceived effects of propositions on
the 1990 California ballot, specifically providing term limits on
state-wide office-holders and state legislators: Some responses
follow:

Richard Montjoy, Assemblyman: "By 1996 there would be an all new
legislature less prone to special interests..."

Robert Presley, State Senator: "Proposition would be reversed because
it won't work.  It would increase lobbyists' power; amateurs would run
... state ..."

Karl Kurtz, National Conference of State Legislatures: "Legislature
would lose ... leaders and committee chairmen; power would pass to the
executive branch."

Marc Petracca, Professor: "...would create spinoff effect to other
states, decrease special interests, but increase party
interest."
