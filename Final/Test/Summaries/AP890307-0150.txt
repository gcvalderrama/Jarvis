During a partial solar eclipse, dozens of people at Caltec in Pasadena
used telescopes to see mountains on the edge of the moon silhouetted
against the sun. They got an added visual treat: gas jets also visible
were on the sun's surface producing the most intense solar flare since
1984.  The partial eclipse was somewhat visible west of a line from
Mazatlan, Mexico, to Chicago, and most defined from Anchorage, Alaska.
Scientists had warned of possible eye damage from staring directly at
the sun.  Total solar eclipses are visible from any given location
once every four centuries, but from somewhere every two years.
