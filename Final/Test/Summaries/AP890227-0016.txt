In the transition from winter to spring, hot weather stirs the air and
helps form thunderstorms and tornadoes, violently twisting winds
reaching down from thunderclouds. Tornadoes increase in March and peak
in May, averaging 166 that month, but they can occur any
month. November's average is 23 but last year unusually warm and wet
weather helped trigger 121. Tornadoes are most likely between noon and
sunset and least likely just before sunrise. Typically they are 50
yards wide and travel two miles on the ground, usually heading
northeast, and often come in groups. Tornado deaths are down due to
increased public awareness.
