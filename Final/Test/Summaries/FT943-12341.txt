The Tokai coastal of Japan has what may be the world's most dense
array of geophysical instruments.  Data is telemetered to experts in
Tokyo in hopes that they can recognize indications of an imminent
earthquake.  Most world observers have lost hope in predicting
earthquakes and skeptics in Japan believe the Tokai project is money
wasted and misleads the public.  The Tokai section last ruptured in
1854.  If it were to rupture again it could cause a great earthquake
endangering up to ten million people.  The Tokai area is the only one
in Japan that is so instrumented.  The Tokyo-Tokai area is overdue for
a big quake.
