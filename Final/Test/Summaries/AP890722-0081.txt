A 1987 Maine state constitutional amendment made that states right to
keep and bear arms the most broad and least restrictive of any of the
43 similar state amendments.  So broad, in fact, that even convicted
felons may own guns.  A Maine judge dismissed a gun charge against a
felon who was also charged with other crimes.  Maine's amendment
reads: "Every citizen has a right to keep and bear arms, and this
right shall never be questioned".
