Nationwide, last summer was the second worst wildfire season since the
government started keeping records. The 5.9 million acres that burned
in 1988 did not match the 28 million acres destroyed in 1926, but the
$583.8 million spent to fight 75,000 fires set a record. Nearly 1.5
million acres in the greater Yellowstone ecosystem burned, including
705,000 acres within the national park.  For two months, fires
threatened the small Montana tourist town of Cooke City and its tiny
suburb, Silver Gate. Residents and tourists were evacuated twice. An
early snowfall saved the towns, but pockets of fire could still lie
smoldering under the snow.
