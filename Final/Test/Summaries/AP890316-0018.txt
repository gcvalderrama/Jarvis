The earliest known reliable record of a total solar eclipse dates from
1223 BC, about 150 years later than had previously been held
reliable. Clay tablets found in Syria provided basis for both dates
but translations and the calendars in use at the time are
uncertain. Time of year for the eclipse and appearance of Mars at the
same time led researchers to doubt the earlier date.  Concurrent
eclipse and appearance of Mars caused much anxiety.  Liver
examinations (not further identified) by the ancients noted on a
tablet said "danger" adding to the fears.
