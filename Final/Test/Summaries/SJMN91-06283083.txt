The beating of Rodney King by the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD)
has acted as a catalyst for public criticism of this department.  An
independent commission found racism, brutality and other faults within
the LAPD.

Meanwhile, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department escaped adverse
publicity by keeping a low profile--until the occurrence of killings
and robbery by his officers.  The sheriff is resisting change,
believing that his department is a model force.

Some groups believe that nothing will change in the long term in spite
of the need for police reform.  Police cite social ills as the
cause.
