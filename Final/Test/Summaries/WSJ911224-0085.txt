Economists dislike term limits as another interference with free
markets.  However, the Wall Street Journal, who supports that
principle, surprisingly advocates term limits.
  
One argument is that incumbents' access to funds, media, travel and
mail privileges give them an unfair advantage. Opponents say the
public can discern this.

Another point raised is that a citizen Congress would provide better
government. Those opposed cite valuable experience.

Proponents say incumbents are usually re-elected, but opponents say
the system works and representation conforms with the publics' wishes.

Incumbents' seniority provide their districts with access to federal
programs.  Term limits would be a disadvantage unless all districts
were limited.
