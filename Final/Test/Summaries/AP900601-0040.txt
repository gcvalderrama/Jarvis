The 1990 hurricane season starts today amid fears of a new age of
destructive storms.  The season ends November 30.

Robert Spears, head of the National Hurricane Center in Miami, says
most growing coastal communities are ill-prepared.  Population growth
on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts from 1960-2010 will range from 60% to
200% leading to greater destruction and loss of life from hurricanes.
Greater preparedness and emergency planning are necessary, according
to Sheets, who predicts more and greater hurricanes.

Gilbert (1988) and Hugo (1989) left 350 dead and billions in damage.
Hugo showed inadequacies in emergency planning, broadcasting and use
of unsuitable shelters.
