The World Bank annual report revealed that Third World countries paid
$50.1 billion more to service debts last year, than they received in
new loans. This net cash drain began in 1984.  The Third World debt is
estimated to be $993 billion, with an annual debt service "interest
and principle payments" of $143 billion.  The Bank report also noted
mixed results with Third World economies, with some improvement
generally in nations with sensible economic policies and none in
nations with heavily state-owned economies.  Industrialized nations
need to increase their help and the Bank plans to emphasis programs to
ease poverty and help the environment.
