A single-engine airplane crashed Tuesday on the outskirts of
Albuquerque while trying to land at nearby Coronado Airport.  All five
people aboard were killed.  Identities of the victims were not
immediately available.  A witness reported the plane was having
difficulty attempting a landing because of high winds and sprinkling
rain.  A gust of wind hit the plane as it was banking and caused it to
crash nose first into the ground.  Witnesses went to the crash site
but retreated when it appeared to plane might blow up.  Authorities
are in route to the crash site to conduct an investigation.
