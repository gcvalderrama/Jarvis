Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, the number two official in the ruling
Industrial Revolutionary Party, was assassinated last week. This was a
blow to Ernesto Zedillo, Mexico's incoming president, who hopes to
reform Mexico's governing party and the country's corrupt legal and
judicial systems. It was a setback because it is alleged that the
killing was ordered by a federal deputy and a second person with ties
to the Gulf drug cartel. It demonstrates that Zedillo's reform efforts
will meet fierce and violent opposition. Massieu's death suggests that
political reactionaries and drug traffickers were involved in the
March assassination of Luis Colosio.
