Leola Williams, mother of now Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas
celebrated the news that her son was confirmed to the High Court.  As
the votes were announced she began to sing a spiritual and said that
she never doubted the outcome.  Asked what she would say to Anita Hill
if given the chance, Mrs Williams said she would tell her to
pray. "She needs God bad..."  Local residents in Pinpoint, Georgia,
the hometown of Thomas shared in Williams' celebration and joined her
in saying the 23rd Psalm.  They had believed and supported Thomas
during the hearings.
