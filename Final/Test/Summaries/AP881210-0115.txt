A USAF A-10 Thunderbolt II jet tore through a working-class
neighborhood in Remscheid, Germany, Thursday, killing six people. The
pilot inadvertently flew into clouds while attempting close formation
with another aircraft, then initiated a separation maneuver, which is
normal when two aircraft in formation lose visual contact. The lead
aircraft climbed but the second A-10 continued descending, perhaps
disoriented.  Witnesses reported fire in one engine before the
crash. A temporary suspension of low- level missions was ordered. 12
major military aircraft accidents have killed 95 people this year,
including 70 people killed at an August air show crash at the US base
at Ramstein.
