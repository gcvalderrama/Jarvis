President Fujimori has admitted that talks have been held between
government representatives and Shining Path leaders in prison, led by
Abimael Guzman who is serving a life sentence.  Supposedly the main
points of any peace agreement of shining Path and the government would
include the surrender of weapons and a general amnesty without victors
or vanquished.  According to a TV journalist, a ten point agreement
has been formed with its main aspect to "stop the popular war with its
four forms of fighting: terrorism, selective murders, sabotage, and
armed agitation and propaganda".  Government authorities have not
confirmed or denied the accuracy of the agreement.
