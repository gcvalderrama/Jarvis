On Sunday, Exxon Shipping Co. said an unqualified mate was piloting
the Exxon Valdez before it ran aground.  The tanker hit a rock outside
shipping lanes then slid about two miles hitting more underwater
rocks.  Ten sizable holes were found in the hull.  Also on Sunday, the
team for the National Transportation Safety Board arrived.  Experts
from an international bird rescue center set up a rehabilitation
center and otter experts are due to arrive tomorrow.  Today, high
winds are expected to hit the tanker, which still had 1 million
barrels of oil on board.  Exxon has promised an organized cleanup
plan.
