Florida's losses from Hurricane Andrew for which US insurers expect to
pay $7.3B make it the most costly insured catastrophe in the US, even
before the Andrew claims from Louisiana are tallied.  In southern
Florida at least 150,000 residents are homeless or living amid ruins,
and nearly twice that number still have no electricity.  President
Bush made his second trip to the devastated area and pledged the
government would stay with the clean-up until completed.  Andrew has
exceeded the insurance costs of Hurricane Hugo, the Oakland fire and
tornado and hail damages.  The insurance industry should have adequate
reserves to cover the losses.  Wall Street has remained calm.
