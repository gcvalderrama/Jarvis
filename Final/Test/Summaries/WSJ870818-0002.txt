A Northwest Airlines jet crashed Sunday in Detroit, killing at least
154 people.  Engine failure appeared to be the culprit, but FAA
officials would not speculate on the reasons for the crash saying it
was too early to draw firm conclusions. Following a summer of snafus,
the accident could be a catalyst for reassessing the Nation's
air-travel system.  All jetliners must be capable of take-off ascent,
even if one engine fails, if the aircraft is within prescribed weight
limits.  The plane had a large fuel load and was jammed with
passengers.  Congress is expected to act on aviation bills this
fall.
