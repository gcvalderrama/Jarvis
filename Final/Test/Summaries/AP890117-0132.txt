A black police sergeant, Don Jackson, set up a sting operation against
the Long Beach police in early 1989.  Jackson arranged to have a news
team follow him and a companion in their car through a high crime area
of Long Beach.  The tape shows a white officer searching Jackson with
his hands up, then pushing him through a plate glass window.  The tape
is played before a national audience.
  
Long Beach officials promised an investigation.  Jackson's supervisor
said he was looking for trouble.  Jackson chose the Long Beach police
because of the large number of complaints by minorities.
