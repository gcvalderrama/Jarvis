Los Angeles Police, in January 1990, were applying painful techniques
in getting non-violent, anti-abortion protesters to comply.  These
methods, twisting arms, etc., are called "pain compliance" techniques.

Traditional political viewpoints are reversed.  Pro-choice liberals
support the police while anti-abortion republicans voice "police
state" rhetoric.

Protesters complain that police "come along" holds result in serious
injuries and have filed complaints.

The volatility of the abortion issue clouds the way many think about
police use of force.

A police authority says restrictions on pain compliance techniques
will embolden demonstrators.  An opposing view is that using pain
techniques on non-violent demonstrators is barbaric.
