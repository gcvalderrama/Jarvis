According to a study in the NE Journal of Medicine, blacks contract TB
six times more often than whites when living conditions are identical,
based on a study of residents of Arkansas nursing homes.  Disease-free
patients at admission were re-tested after two months: twice as many
blacks as whites had contracted tuberculosis.

Prison data also shows a similar trend.

Scientists theorize that blacks originate from Africa, where TB is
rare, while European whites have been exposed for generations.  They
point out that blacks have a similar resistance to malaria, common in
sub-Saharan Africa.
