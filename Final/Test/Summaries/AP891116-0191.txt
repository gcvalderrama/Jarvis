Tornadoes and severe thunderstorms killed at least 27 people
Wednesday. The worst hit was Huntsville, Alabama, where 17 people were
killed and 1000 left homeless.  A Kentucky storm believed to be a
tornado cut a mile-long swath of destruction through the town of
Flaherty. Tornadoes were also reported in Mississippi, Georgia, North
and South Carolina, Ohio, Indiana, Pennsylvania, West Virginia,
Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, and New York. Thunderstorms and high
winds were also wide-spread and caused power outages and other
damage. They caused deaths in Illinois and New York, where a tree
falling on an elementary school roof killed 7 children.
