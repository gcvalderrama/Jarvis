Public opinion polls show a deep feeling of public dismay and disgust
toward Congress that crosses party lines.  Voters feel they aren't
being heard and are losing confidence in the electoral system.

The 1990 elections reflected this feeling: although 96% of incumbents
were reelected, the margins of victory declined for the first time
since WWII.  The disaffection was fueled by frustration rather than
ideology: Voters want movement on healthcare, taxes and jobs and want
indefensible percs removed.

Opponents fear a power shift to unelected staff and lobbyists and
think committee assignments should be rotated so that members can
continue to grow.
