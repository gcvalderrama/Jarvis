Confounding predictions of its demise four years ago during the worst
diamond slump since the 1930s, De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., the
South African concern that controls 80% of the world's uncut-diamond
market, is thriving.  De Beers's Central Selling Organization, known
as the Syndicate, is the pipeline between diamond mines and dealers
based mainly in Antwerp, Belgium; Bombay, India; Tel Aviv, Israel, and
New York.  Some analysts warn, however, that De Beers's future may be
affected by the surge in diamond output elsewhere, notably Australia.
World diamond production has soared to 88 million carats from 47
million carats in 1982.
