De Beers, the South African group that dominates world trade in rough
(uncut) diamonds, still has complete faith in its ability to maintain
stability in the diamond market.  The Jwaneng mine is the richest
diamond mine in the world in terms of the value of the stones it
yields.  Meanwhile, 160km west of Kimberley in the northern Cape
Province of South Africa, the Finsch mine, where operations started in
1964, has opened an new underground 423 meter pit.  The finch mine had
run into difficulties because of turmoil in the diamond market caused
mainly my uncertainties about Russian Exports.
