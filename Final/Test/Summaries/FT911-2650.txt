Lewis Preston will take over as World Bank president in September.  He
is being given much advice on how to turn the Bank around, after a
decade of relative failure, and institute policies to ease the Third
World debt crisis and widespread poverty. One billion people live on
less than $1 a day.  More than 110 million children lack access to
even primary education.  Real per capita incomes have declined.  The
Third World debt is $1,341 billion.  Changes are recommended for past
positions of not forgiving debts and structural adjustment loans, and
placing more emphasis on infrastructure investment and direct poverty
relief.
