26-year old Jamaican transplant to Canada Ben Johnson won an Olympic gold medal on 
Saturday when he ran the 100 meters in a world record time of 9.79 seconds. Johnson 
dedicated the medal to his mother and all Canadian citizens. The medal was taken away 
when Johnson tested positive for Stanozolol, an illegal muscle-building steroid. He had 
earlier been awarded the Order of Canada and a medal from Queen Elizabeth at the 
Commonwealth Games. He flew home to Canada in the seclusion of the cockpit and 
hurdled a hedge with a jacket over his head to duck reporters.
