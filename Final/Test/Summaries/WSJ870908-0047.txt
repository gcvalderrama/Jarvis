De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. is raising its diamond prices an
average of 10% next month.  The South African concern that controls
80% of the world diamond market sells a vast array of diamonds,
varying in quality and size, dealers say.  So the increase could be as
much as 20% on top-grade diamonds.  The rise follows an average price
increase of 14.5% last year.  Prices of one-carat D-flawless diamonds
have risen to about $14,800 a carat from $12,000 at the beginning of
the year, dealers say.  In 1985, a top quality stone was $8,500 a
carat, down from an average of $55,000 in 1980.
