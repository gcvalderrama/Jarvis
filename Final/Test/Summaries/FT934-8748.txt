Investors like the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).  They
believe it will lift profits because of a more open trading
environment and that the U.S. will have the greatest growth in
exports.  They fear if it is defeated an era of protectionism will
begin, the world economic growth will slow, and there will be
inflation.  Political costs of failure will be the Clinton
administration's loss of credibility and effectiveness at home and in
any future trade negotiations.  Although the up-coming vote is too
close to call, some believe Gore's success in the debate with Perot
has swayed public opinion.
