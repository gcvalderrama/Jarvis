British and French workmen, on 30 October 1990, completed the link-up
between Britain and France via the "Chunnel."

The Chunnel will accommodate high speed trains carrying passengers and
freight. A train trip from London to Paris will take only three hours.

The drilling effort was completed in three years.

There were nine accidental deaths during the construction phase; the
cost will total 16.7 billion dollars.

The tunnel is 31 miles in length. No profit is expected until the end
of the century.

France wants the Chunnel to improve the economy of northern France;
Britain fears the import of "Continental ills."
