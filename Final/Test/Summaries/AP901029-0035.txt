Terry Barnes, a 24-year old stockbroker, was shot and killed by police
in his own apartment.  It was another blow against the Kansas City,
Missouri Police Department struggling against charges of racism and
brutality.  Both the victim and the officer are white, although other
incidents have involved black citizens.
  
Other charges against the police have included excessive force and
racism.  One involved a black Roman Catholic priest from Nigeria who
was attacked by police while laying on the ground.  The priest said
officers stopped him on suspicion of drunken driving because they
could not understand his foreign speech.
