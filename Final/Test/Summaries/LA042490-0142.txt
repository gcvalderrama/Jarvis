Publicists for Elizabeth Taylor reported she is at St. John's Medical
Center with pneumonia and is being treated with antibiotics.  She was
transferred there from another hospital after a sinus infection
worsened into pneumonia.

Miss Taylor had near-fatal pneumonia in 1961; at that time a
tracheotomy was performed to help her breathe.

She has suffered health problems since a fall from a horse at age 13
caused back problems.  In 1983 she acknowledged a 35-year addiction to
pain and sleeping medications and has been treated for alcohol and
drug abuse at the Betty Ford Clinic at Rancho Mirage.
