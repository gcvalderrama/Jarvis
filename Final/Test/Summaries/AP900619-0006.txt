1990 is one of the worst tornado years on record, with 726 storms so
far compared to the 6-month average of 482.  Persistent West Coast low
pressure in the upper atmosphere is keeping the jet stream anchored at
a southern latitude, but as summer warms the land, cold air from
Canada will retreat and the jet stream will move north. Studies
indicate tornadoes concentrate in regions for 5-6 years. This year a
Kansas tornado's winds reached 300 mph and 101 tornadoes touched down
in one weekend, leaving 9 dead.  Computers giving access to many data
sources are improving tornado warnings, leading to fewer deaths.
