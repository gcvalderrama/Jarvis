Roy Innis of CORE finds it ironic that most black leaders support gun
control.  He traces America's gun control movement from the Dred Scott
court decision of 1857.  Chief Justice Taney warned that if blacks
were entitled to the privileges and immunities of citizens, they could
keep and bear arms.  Racial paranoia about black men with guns then
intensified.  The 14th and 15th Amendments prevented laws that were
explicitly racist.  Innis notes that of the handgun permits issued in
New York City, only 2% are issued to blacks many of whom live or work
in high-crime areas and have need for protection.
