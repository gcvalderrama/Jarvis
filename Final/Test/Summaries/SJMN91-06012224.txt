Ben Johnson's return to racing Friday, after losing an Olympic gold medal on Sept. 24, 
1988 and being suspended for two years because of a positive drug test, drew a record 
crowd of 17,050 and 500 journalists from 14 countries. Johnson received a standing 
ovation when introduced. He got off to a slow start and finished second. It was his first 
indoor loss in 11 meets dating to 1987. His time then of 5.55 seconds for 50 meters is still 
listed as the record. His upper body is less bulky now and his face is less puffy. He still 
weighs 174 pounds and bench-presses 365.
