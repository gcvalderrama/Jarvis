The Clinton administration soon will announce support for the North
American Development Bank, which is expected to gain the votes of at
least eight Hispanic representatives for the North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA).  The administration now believes it has 200-210 of
the 218 votes needed for ratification.  Clinton is giving impassioned
speeches, inviting undecided representatives to the White House, and
sending cabinet members to congressional districts.  Anti-NAFTA forces
count 5-10 republicans against and 190-200 democrats against, with
10-15 democrats leaning against. Anti-NAFTA activities include labor
union exhibits and speeches by workers who lost their jobs to
Mexico.
