The Senate has contentiously voted to exclude illegal immigrants from
congressional reapportionment numbers.  The House may follow.  The
debate, often couched in constitutional arguments, is largely driven
by politics and geography.  Counting illegal immigrants in 1990 will
most likely result in one more seat for California and one less for
Pennsylvania.  However, seats for Connecticut, Michigan, North
Carolina and Alabama are also at risk, while Texas, Florida and New
York might benefit.  All sides expect a lawsuit.  In 1980, a federal
appeals court upheld the current system of counting illegal aliens.
This year a federal district court ruled similarly.
