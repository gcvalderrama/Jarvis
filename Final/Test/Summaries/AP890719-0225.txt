Senator Richard Shelby, D-AL, sponsored the passed immigration bill
amendment to exclude illegal aliens from the redistricting process.
The amendment instructs the Secretary of Commerce to make such
population adjustments using methods and procedures as determined
feasible and appropriate.  Opponents say it's unconstitutional; our
founders wanted everyone counted for apportionment.  Proponents say
that our founders had no concept of illegal aliens because they didn't
exist prior to immigration restrictions that began in 1875.  The
Supreme Court may have to decide.  After the 1980 census, the
government estimated there were 2.57 million illegal aliens in the
U.S.  Some other guesses were far higher.
