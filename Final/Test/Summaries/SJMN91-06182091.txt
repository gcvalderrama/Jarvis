The cease-fire agreed upon yesterday is faltering as federal troops,
acting outside government control, move to subjugate secessionist
Slovenia.

Serbia has blocked the election of Stipe Masic, a Croat, as
Yugoslavian president, a provision of a peace plan devised by Prime
Minister Marcovik, brokered by the European Community and accepted by
Slovenia, Croatia and Serbia.  Other provisions are for the army to
disengage and Slovenia and Croatia to delay their declarations of
independence.

Meanwhile, Slovenia refuses to be represented at a meeting of the
Yugoslav presidency, while Serbia forms a militia.

Slovenia has ruled out a return to Yugoslavia.
