Brazil led Third World countries in asking for debt relief help from
the industrialized nations.  Yesterday the Brazilian Foreign Minister
said hunger is endemic throughout Asia, Africa, and much of America.
In West Berlin, finance ministers of 22 richer countries demanded
action to help with repayment of the $1.2 trillion debt.  There have
been calls for creditors to write off some debts, reschedule other
debts, and increased financial aid from industrial nations, which
spend an average of only 0.34% of their GNP on help to developing
nations.  Seven key, non-communist, industrialized nations recently
approved a plan to help the poorest nations.
