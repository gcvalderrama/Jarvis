Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson, 26, is accused of using the illegal anabolic steroid 
Stanozolol after his urine sample proved positive for drugs. He was stripped of the 
Olympic gold medal won three days ago for running the world's fastest 100-meter dash, 
automatically suspended from international competition for two years, and banned from 
Canada's national team for life. Johnson denies any drug use and left for Toronto in 
shock. His sister Clare Rodney refuses to believe the accusation. His coach suggests a 
drink of Johnson's was spiked. Johnson had been a hero to many sports fans in Canada, 
his native Jamaica, and around the world.
