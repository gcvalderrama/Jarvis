Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta, the presidential candidate of the
Mexican Revolutionary Party, PRI, was assassinated on 23 March in
Tijuana on the Baja California Peninsula.  The assassination was
widely covered in the foreign press. Spokespeople for the governments
of Columbia, Cuba, El Salvador and Venezuela separately condemned the
assassination, and each of the countries expressed their condolences
to the Mexican people. A liberal candidate in Columbia said that the
assassination was the result of "savage capitalism". The ruling party
in El Salvador called Colosio's death the "cowardly assassination
perpetrated by antidemocratic forces".
