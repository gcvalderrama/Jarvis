Hearings are planned next year into how the U.S. Forest Service
handled last summer's stubborn wildfires that scorched the West,
including one-third of Yellowstone National Park. Five million acres
were charred, including 706,000 acres in Yellowstone. The Forest and
National Park Services spent a combined $300 million fighting the
summer fires. The most severe were in and around Yellowstone and
Alaska, although there were fires in the South, California and the
Pacific Northwest. Drought conditions, high winds, and a tremendous
build-up of tinder, in Yellowstone in particular, helped make the 1988
fires the worst in a hundred years.
