John Kelley, 83, is preparing for his 60th Boston Marathon on April
15.  Kelley won the Boston in 1935 and 1945 and was runner-up seven
times and finished in 5:05 last year.  He has been the oldest
competitor for 15 years.  An older man competed in the 1930's, but he
walked, not ran.  Kelley is considered a medical wonder, undergoing
tests of the Cooper Aerobics Center in Dallas, where Dr. Kenneth
Cooper declared he had the body of a man 23 years younger.  The Boston
Marathon in televised and has $402,000 in prize money, with 13,000
runners expected to compete.
