The December freeze killed heavy brush and millions of trees,
particularly eucalyptus, that are now primed to burn. 10% of the trees
in the 18 national forests have been killed by the drought or the
insect infestations it spawned. After five years of drought which has
parched the landscape, these are the ingredients for potentially one
of the worst wildfire seasons in California's history, unless an
unusually cool summer intervenes. March rains delayed fire season
until mid-June, but they have nurtured grass that soon will turn
tinder dry.  California's worst fire year was 1987, when 900,000 acres
burned.
