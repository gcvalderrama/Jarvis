Both sides of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) issues
are active, as a new Wall Street Journal poll shows 36% of Americans
opposing the agreement with only 25% supporting it.  Fifty percent do
not believe more jobs will be gained than lost, and 54% think wages
will go down.  Pro-NAFTA activities included testimony from four ex-
presidents, administration officials on speaking tours, and government
agencies passing out propaganda.  Gore has praised NAFTA's
environmental safeguards.  Except for the speaker, House democratic
leaders are silent.  Anti-NAFTA activity involves grassroots' exploits
and strategic planning with warnings that 20 years of environmental
protection work will be undermined.
