A Rush for diamonds by miners in Angola and Canada are threatening the
ability for the De Beers cartel to keep its tight grip on the diamond
market.  In Canada's Northwest Territories where 81 small diamonds
were found, prospectors are laying claim to every piece of land within
300km of the discovery.  In Angola, more than $1 million worth of
diamonds a day are being smuggled out of that country for sale in
Antwerp.  An estimated 50,000 private-enterprise diggers are at work
already and their numbers are being swelled by 500 a day.  This rise
in illegal mining started in May, 1991.
