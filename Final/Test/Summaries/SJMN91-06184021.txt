Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas credits his achievements to his
grandparents, who shaped his views on individualism, race and society.
Some black political activists are suspicious of Thomas for those
views, but it has been pointed out that his views are in the tradition
of Booker T.  Washington who advocated education, self-reliance and
mutual support.  Thomas, who had attended an all-black Catholic
school, also thanked the nuns.  At one time he had wanted to become a
priest and was accepted at a seminary, but reaction by other
seminarians disgusted him so he left after one year.
