So far this season, 31,000 brush and timber fires have been reported
in seven Western states and Alaska and Georgia.  1,111,000 acres have
burned so far compared to 765,000 acres last season.  In the West, the
fires were fought in Utah's Diamond Park and Vinta Canyon; Northern
California's Sierra foothills; Colorado's drought-stricken mountains
and eastern plains; Wyoming's Bridger-Teton National Forest; Arizona's
Mount Graham, Peloncillo and Rincon Mountains areas; and New Mexico's
Gila National Forest.  Four large fires burned in interior Alaska, one
burned in Georgia's Okeefeenokee Swamp, and another in north central
Washington.  Firefighters have contended with wind and high
temperatures.
