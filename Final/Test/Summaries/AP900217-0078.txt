Drugs now available can put AIDS patients into remission and a vaccine
to protect against the disease is possible, according to a panel of
AIDS experts at the American Association of the Advancement of
Science.

Developing countries may not benefit from new drugs, however, because
they are expensive, difficult to administer and require monitoring,
making the vaccine more important.

The Allergy Institute also reports an epidemic of TB in AIDS patients
in inner cities.  The disease is now increasing after a long decline,
and unlike AIDS, is easily transmitted through the air.
