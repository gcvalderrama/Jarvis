Police forces in 50 cities in the U.S. have been charged with
brutality and excessive use of force against anti-abortion activists.
Some arrests have led to injury and sexual abuse of women
demonstrators.  Operation Rescue includes mostly Catholic and
Protestant participants.  They do not use force and have instructions
to go limp when being arrested.  They do not appear to have much
public support.

Operation Rescue demonstrators are involved in denying some citizens
their rights.  Perhaps this is the reason why there is some reluctance
on the part of civil rights authorities to pursue police brutality
cases involving Rescue demonstrators.
