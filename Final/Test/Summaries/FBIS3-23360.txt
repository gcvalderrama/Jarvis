A Jordanian diplomat, Na'ib al-Ma'yitah, was assassinated in Beirut on
29 January. Less than one month later Lebanese security forces in
coordination with Jordanian forces had determined that the
assassination was planned and executed by Fatah-the Revolutionary
Council, the FRC, and Jordanian fundamentalist groups sponsored by
Iran. The FRC is the Abu-Nidal group, and it harbored a grudge against
Jordan ever since the group was expelled from that country. Thirty FRC
members have been arrested in Jordan. The FRC took immediate steps
after the assassination, moving personnel out of Lebanon to minimize
damage to the organization.
