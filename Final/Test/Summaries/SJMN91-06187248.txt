Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas is the product of harsh Southern
history.  He was abandoned by his father, raised by grandparents,
attended an all-black Catholic school, and went on to Holy Cross
College and Yale, starting out as a liberal who became increasingly
conservative.  Missouri Attorney General Danforth recruited Thomas for
his office and when Danforth became a senator, Thomas joined his
staff.  Thomas became chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission in 1982.  Liberals fear that a Justice Thomas would work to
reverse civil rights gains of recent years, but his supporters see him
as a centrist.
