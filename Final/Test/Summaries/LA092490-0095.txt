Two years ago, 100-meter record-holder Ben Johnson lost his gold medal after testing 
positive for anabolic steroids at the Seoul Olympics. He was given a two-year suspension 
from competition which ends today. The Hamilton Spectator Indoor Games January 11th 
will mark his return to competition. He will receive $10,000 Canadian to appear. He 
received $60,000 to race in Stockholm and will receive $30,000 to appear in the January 
18th Sunkist invitational. Loren Seagrave replaced Charlie Francis as Johnson's coach. 
Adopting a rule in his name, the IAAF erased all Johnson's 1983-1989 times. Johnson 
has trained hard and believes he will return to his 1988 form.
