Nearly 10,000 firefighters in five Western states are battling
hundreds of blazes, most sparked by lightning last week. Over 1.3
million acres in the contiguous US have burned since January, compared
to the 2.1 million acres burned by this time last year. Heat and
drought across a wide swath of the West made 1988 the worst fire
season in 30 years, with 6 million acres burnt in the West and Alaska;
and the most expensive in US history in terms of firefighting
resources committed. Yellowstone National Park, where fire blackened 1
million acres, nearly half the park's territory, was one of the
hardest-hit areas.
