Negotiations for a new contract between Botswana, the world's most
important diamond producer in value terms, and De Beers, the South
African diamond group are taking much longer than expected.  Some
Botswana politicians want to change De Beers' exclusive sales contract
so that part of their country's output can be sold independently of
the South African group's international cartel.  De Beers is resisting
any change and argues that if Botswana chose not to sell its
production exclusively through cartel, the cartel's ability to
regulate the distribution of rough diamonds would be
compromised.
