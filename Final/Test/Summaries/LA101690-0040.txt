The World Health Organization reports that tuberculosis has become the
world's deadliest disease, killing nearly three million people yearly;
and that deaths could increase if controls are not initiated quickly.
  
WHO attributes the increase to the growing AIDS epidemic and says that
three million people have both TB and AIDS.

They estimate that by 2000, 15-20 million adults will have HIV and
that TB cases and deaths will rise sharply, especially in the Third
World.

TB is an infectious disease of the lungs.  Many persons carry the TB
organism but are not infectious to others unless the immune system is
impaired, as in HIV.
