Caribbean and Central American governments are waiting to see what
will happen to them with the North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA).  These nations would like free access to the U.S. and
Canadian markets at parity with Mexico's de facto entry into NAFTA.
This is not likely to occur, although Bill Clinton and Carlos Salinas
had assured the Caribbean basin countries that they would not be
adversely affected. The basin is a big importer of U.S. goods and
Clinton has promised it some benefits from NAFTA.  The basin leaders
fear any parity offers will come with conditions--such as workers'
rights, democracy, and environmental legislation.
