Ben Johnson admitted his steroid use this week at a Canadian inquiry. He testified that 
his seven-year involvement with illegal performance-enhancing drugs included injections 
before the 1987 World Championships in Rome, where he set the world record of 9.83 
seconds, although his test results afterward were negative. Johnson clocked 9.79 at the 
Seoul Olympics but lost that record and his gold medal and was barred from competition 
for two years after testing positive for an anabolic steroid. Opponent Carl Lewis thinks 
Johnson should be allowed back into competition after his suspension because he finally 
told the truth and has spoken out against drugs.
