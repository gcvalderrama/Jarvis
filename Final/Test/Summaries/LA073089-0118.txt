Stung by some recent reversals, the National Rifle Association is
increasing its efforts to protest semi-automatic gun control bills.
President Bush, a life member of the NRA, angered the organization by
imposing a ban on the import of assault rifles.  The organization
feels that Arizona Senator DeConcini is a traitor to the NRA's cause
and was unhappy with a statement by Barry Goldwater that
semiautomatics "have no place in anybody's arsenal".  NRA lobbyists
are now facing heavy lobbying efforts from the other side.  The
organization has compromised on banning cop-killer bullets but plans
to increase its spending on lobbying efforts.
