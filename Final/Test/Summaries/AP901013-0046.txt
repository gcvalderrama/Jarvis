Rifaat el-Mahgoub, leader of the Egyptian parliament, and the second
highest ranking government official, was assassinated Friday. Five
others were killed by the assassins who rode motorbikes past
el-Mahgoub's automobile. They have not been apprehended.  Before
Friday there had been no assassinations in Egypt since the shooting of
President Anwar Sadat nine years ago. Friday's assassination is being
blamed on Iraqi agents. The Egyptian Interior Minister had warned that
Saddam Hussein was sending saboteurs into Egypt to assassinate
officials in retaliation for Egypt's support of the United States
during the Gulf War.
