Latvia experienced an increase of 14% in tuberculosis morbidity and
44% in mortality in 1993 as compared to 1992.

Inta Pavlovska, of the State Tuberculosis and Lung Disease Center,
said the increase may be related to poor socioeconomic conditions and
the fact that no laws require mandatory treatment of infectious cases.

In November of last year a proposal was submitted to the Cabinet of
Ministers to require mandatory treatment of such cases.  To date the
proposal has not been reviewed.

Presently Latvia has 11 state tuberculosis hospitals; the latest
opened in January of this year, treating mainly chronic alcoholics
suffering from tuberculosis.
