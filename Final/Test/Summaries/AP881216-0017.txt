A panel reporting to the secretaries of Agriculture and Interior
recommended a moratorium in the government's "let it burn" policy in
order for the Forest Service and National Park Service to refine fire
management plans.  The panel experts said there were environmental
benefits to letting parks and wilderness areas burn, but in some cases
the social and economic effects may be unacceptable. The report said:
fire management plans should conform to departmental policies,
employees should understand the policies, a common vocabulary should
be used, and there should be agreement between agencies beforehand of
what to do if fires move across administrative boundaries.
