British Government officials continue to deny a causal relationship
between bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), the "mad cow" disease,
and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD).  Cases of BSE continue to grow
even though officials said the disease would peak last year.  A
farmer, whose herd of dairy cows was diseased, died of CJD last year.
The government's monitor of CJD says there have been no cases among
butchers or vets and he believes the farmer's case was a coincidence.
Statistical analysis shows that the probability of one CJD case in
workers with infected cattle is 1 in 20.
