Next week, European Community health ministers will debate a German
threat to the Single Market free trade rule.  This is a proposal to
ban German importation of British beef to end potential transmission
to European livestock and stem fears of disease's transfer to humans.
The nearly ruined British cattle industry claims the fears are
baseless.  "Mad cow" disease, caused by feed containing offal from
sheep infected with scrapies, has infected over 120,000 British
cattle.  More than 8,000 were born after this feed was banned.
Theories of the cause of these cases include use of stored banned
food, vertical cow to calf transmission, and immune systems damaged by
pesticides.
