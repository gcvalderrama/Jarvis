The largest oil spill in U.S. history, 11.3 million gallons, occurred
early Friday when the Exxon Valdez ran aground on Bligh Reef in Prince
Williams Sound, Alaska.  The ship had loaded 1.2 million barrels of
oil at the marine terminal at Valdez and was en route to Long Beach,
California.  The terminal was closed on Friday and the flow in the
trans- Alaska pipeline was reduced to 800,000 barrels, from 1.2
million barrels a day.  The area relies on the oil, tourism, and
fishing industries.  The black cod season begins April 1 and herring
fishing begins mid-April.
