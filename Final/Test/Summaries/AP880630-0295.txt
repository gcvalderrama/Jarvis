The Agriculture Department says it has been on top of the drought
since March 1, monitoring the situation, setting up hotlines, and
issuing statements; namely, a "USDA Backgrounder" to be updated every
two weeks listing the department's "drought-related" actions.  The
first lists separate actions taken, including: establishing a Drought
Task Force to constantly monitor the potential situation, allowing
emergency haying and grazing in drought-suffering counties, creating a
joint Federal Interagency Policy Committee, helping cattle producers
by setting aside 50 million to buy ground beef for donation to
schools, and creating a network to assist in locating forage
supplies.
