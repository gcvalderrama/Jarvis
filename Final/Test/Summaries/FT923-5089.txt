Despite an initial faltering and inadequate response to the Hurricane
Andrew devastation, the Administration now appears to have its act
together and President Bush's re-election campaign may, in the end,
not be harmed.  The Federal Emergency Management Agency, saddled with
political appointees was totally unprepared for the disaster, but is
now being "shaped-up".  The Administration is also improving its
standing through the dispensing of largess, such as a promise to
rebuild Homestead Air Base, an important job source for Floridians.
US insurers expect to pay around $500M in claims for Andrew's damage
in Louisiana, taking the total insurance bill to $8B.
