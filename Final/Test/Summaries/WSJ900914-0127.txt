Hurricane Specialist Professor William Gray believes we are entering a
period of increased hurricanes and finds an association with seasonal
rainfall in Africa.

Mr. Gray uses five indicators in his prediction, including rainfall in
the African Sahel area, which has a natural cycle of rainfall and
drought.  He finds that in modern times, when the Sahel is dry,
Atlantic storms decrease in number, but when the Sahel is wet, an
increase occurs.
  
Forecasters are seeking to predict coastal storms more accurately to
provide early warning to heavily populated coastal areas.

There have been nine named storms this year.
