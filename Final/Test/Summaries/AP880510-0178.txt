Khalil Wazir, known by the code name, Abu-Jihad, and second in command
within the PLO, was assassinated on 16 April during a raid on his home
in Tunis. Unidentified Israeli officials said that an Israeli squad
did the killing. This touched off charges and counter-charges. The PLO
claimed that the United States knew of and approved plans for
assassinating Wazir. Yasser Arafat said that the United States was
planning to kill PLO officials if the PLO retaliated by taking action
against American citizens or facilities. The State Department denied
any such intention.
