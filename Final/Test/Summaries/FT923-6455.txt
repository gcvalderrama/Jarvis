Hurricane Andrew moved toward the Alabama-Louisiana-Texas coast
leaving at least eight dead and severe damage in southern Florida. A
million people were ordered out of their homes in Florida and many are
without power.  British insurance adjusters gave an early estimate
that total losses could exceed $15 Billion, claims for which would
mostly fall on US insurers with only light impact on UK companies.
Andrew gathered strength as it moved across the Gulf and there was
concern that it might hit low-lying New Orleans.  Also threatened are
the many oil refining facilities and offshore platforms.  Shell Oil
was evacuating most of the workers from its platforms.
