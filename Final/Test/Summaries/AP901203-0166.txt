At least four moderate earthquakes were recorded on December 3rd, but
none were in the New Madrid area as had been predicted by Iben
Browning.  A spokesman for the US Geological Survey said there is no
way to predict an earthquake precisely, that no two are alike.  On
average, 30 earthquakes are noted by instrumentation each day, but
most are too small to be felt by humans.  Two earthquakes were
recorded in the New Madrid during the fall, a not unusual occurrence.
Some residents of the New Madrid area had taken actions based on the
prediction for December 3rd.
