Peruvian President Garcia said that the Shining Path was pushing their
insurgency into Lima and other coastal towns after two car bombs
exploded near the Government Palace.  The Maoist guerrilla group has
its strength in the jungles and highlands but has had little success
in the urban areas where most of Peru's population lives.  Shining
Path has called on voters to boycott the presidential runoff between
free market activist Mario Llosa and centrist agricultural engineer
Alberto Fujimori.  Garcia called the upsurge in urban violence a
"desperate response" to raids by police.
