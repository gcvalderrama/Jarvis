Meteorologist William Gray predicts more intense Atlantic hurricanes
in the future because of lessening drought in Africa.

Hurricanes usually form from tropical disturbances moving westward
from the Salel region in West Africa.

As classified on the Saffir-Simpson scale; the fiercist hurricane is a
number five, with winds over 155 miles per hour and an atmospheric
pressure dropping drastically.

From 1970 to 1987 only 13 severe storms formed; in 1988 and 1989,
there were five.  Gilbert, in 1989, was the mightiest on record in the
Western Hemisphere.

Global warming may also be a factor.  Hurricanes need a water
temperature of 80 degrees Fahrenheit to sustain themselves.
