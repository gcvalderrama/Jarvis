If the last three years are indicators, the Boston Marathon will
feature speed.  It is expected to be a race of attrition, with early
speedsters burning out.  Last year, 11 checkpoint records were broken
by runners who did not win.  The winner, Gelindo Bordin, ran a patient
race winning in 2:08:19.  Formidable runners from Kenya, Tanzania, and
Ethiopia will be here this year, as will top-ranking British and
U.S. runners.  The women's field is headed by the two fastest female
marathoners is history, Ingrid Kristiansen and Joan Benoit Samuelson.
Sentimental favorite will be Johnny Kelley, 83, running his 60th
Boston.
