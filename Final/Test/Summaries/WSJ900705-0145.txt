Although the British government made an agreement with the French to
build the English Channel tunnel, the British public prefers their
island status.  The "Chunnel" project, nevertheless, is moving ahead
with completion in 1993.

It is a huge construction project--the largest by far in Europe. There
will be three tunnels (two large ones for trains and a smaller service
tunnel). Twenty-seven miles of the service tunnel have been
completed. Its cost may run up to 17.5 billion dollars. It will be an
economic plus for northern Europe. The British public, however,
prefers to keep the Continentals at arm's length.
