The death count from Hurricane Andrew stands at three in the Bahamas
and at least twelve in Florida where Dade County took the brunt of the
storm.  Damage estimates, while preliminary, are up to $20 billion
with Andrew still to strike somewhere along the
Mississippi-Louisiana-Texas coast.  More than two million people have
been advised or ordered to leave coastal areas.  New Orleans is
particularly vulnerable because it lies below sea level but Andrew's
most likely landfall will be west of there.  Insurance claims from
Florida will hit mostly US companies, especially State Farm, Allstate,
and American International.
