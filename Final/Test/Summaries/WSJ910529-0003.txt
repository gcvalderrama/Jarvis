Elizabeth Taylor and the National Enquirer have settled Miss Taylor's
lawsuit against the tabloid.
  
The suit was brought after a June, 1990, article in the Enquirer
alleged that Miss Taylor was drinking during her hospital stay last
year.

The Enquirer has admitted that its information was in error and has
apologized for the article describing Miss Taylor's condition and
activities.

The attorney for Miss Taylor would not divulge the amount of the
settlement but was persuaded it was adequate to forego going to trial.

Miss Taylor says she feels "completely vindicated," and that the
Enquirer acted "promptly and in good faith."
