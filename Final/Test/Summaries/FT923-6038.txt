Hurricane Andrew narrowly missed New Orleans when it made landfall in
Louisiana, 60 miles to the west.  Andrew, claimed to be the costliest
natural disaster in US history nevertheless impacted insurers losses
much less than expected, perhaps less than $1B.  At least one person
died and 75 were injured along the Louisiana coast.  Fourteen died
earlier in Florida and three in the Bahamas.  The oil refining
industry in Louisiana sustained only little damage but lost production
when power was cut.  In Florida, damage was mostly to uninsured
property, but two million people remained without power.
