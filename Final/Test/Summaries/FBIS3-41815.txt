Zoo denizens and other animals are contracting spongiform
encephalopathy, and the kudu may be more susceptible that other
animals.  Five of eight kudu born since 1987 had the disease, but only
one could have eaten contaminated food.  The means of transmission to
the other four have not been determined.  The disease also has been
found in domestic cats, their larger zoo relatives, four other types
of wild antelopes, and minks in the United States.  The appearance of
this disease in breeding programs raises the fear that released
animals could transmit it to the wild.
