Tour companies are now arranging marathon vacations, trips to distant
cities to compete in a marathon race.  Marathon Tours in Boston took
5,500 people last year on 20 tours.  The packages include airfare,
hotel, and race entry, with qualifying times not required.  Choice
locations include London, Berlin, Brussels, Venice, Bermuda, Ireland,
Tele Aviv and Budapest.  Some cities also offer 1/2 marathons or kids
runs.  Tours include guided runs and fun runs, some along scenic
routes.  Promoters acknowledge running is not everyone's idea of a
vacation, but it is a great way to see a city.
