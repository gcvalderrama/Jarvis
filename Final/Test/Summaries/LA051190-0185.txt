Liz Taylor has suffered a relapse and will remain at St. John's
Hospital for six more weeks.

She was near death in April with viral pneumonia.

Miss Taylor's recovery has been complicated by a newly acquired
bacterial pneumonia and yeast infection "...secondary to her stay at
St. John's Hospital and Health Center," doctors said.  They said the
pneumonia is resolving and she is improving.

She has also developed a fungemia (a fungus infection in the blood)
called Candida Albicans which will require six weeks of intravenous
therapy.

Bacterial pneumonia is treatable with antibiotics, thus is considered
less serious than viral pneumonia.
