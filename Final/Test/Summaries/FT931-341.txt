Since declaring independence in 1991, Slovenia has made considerable
progress.  The gap between the new republic and the war-impoverished
former Yugoslavia has widened, but still, southern peace would be a
gain for Slovenia.

Independence has brought peace, privatisation and market reforms.
Slovenia no longer pays support to Yugoslavia or has bank deposits
frozen. Conversely, southern markets, tourism and cheap Serbian raw
materials have dried up, but despite the losses, Slovenia would not go
back.

Slovenia took in 70,000 refugees from Croatia at a cost of 250 million
dollars per year, but was finally forced to seal off the border.

Future goals: a fully-fledged, market-oriented, multi-party
parliamentary democracy.
