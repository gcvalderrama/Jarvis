Shining Path is not seeking reconciliation in Peru and is maintaining
its military position and ideology.  One observer believes that the
Guzman faction of the organization enjoys government favor and that
peace negotiations are being held in secret.  That observer, Carlos
Tapia, believes the government wants to strengthen Guzman's leadership
to counter a hard line faction led by Alberto Durand.  Many of
Guzman's faction are in prison but those of Durand aka "Feliciano" are
free and conduct terrorist acts.  One Guzman supporter in prison has
been allowed to visit other prisons to drum-up support for
Guzman.
