Tomorrow the health ministers in the European Union will discuss a
German proposal to ban all live cattle and beef exports for the UK
because of fears of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).  Brussels
is expected to back London in fighting this ban.  The European
Commission is also expected to take legal action if Bonn seeks a
unilateral ban.  The commission has stated that there is no evidence
of a link between BES and Creutzfeldt- Jakob Disease.  Current
restrictions include a ban on some bovine by-products for human
consumption, export of live cattle over 6 months old, and progeny of
BSE-affected cows, and certification on bone-in exports.
