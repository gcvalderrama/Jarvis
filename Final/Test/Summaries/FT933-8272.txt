Ten thousand animals in Britain have been killed by "mad cow" disease
(BSE), with almost 1,000 new cases a week.  Last week a second dairy
farmer died of Creutzfeldt- Jakob Disease (CJD).  One professor
believes exposure to BSE, not chance, caused the CJD.  Government
officials claim it is only a coincidence, because both diseases have
long incubation periods and patients who developed CJD from growth
hormones had different symptoms.  Annual cases of CJD in the UK are
growing.  BSE and CJD are caused by a prion, an abnormal form of a
protein normally present in the brain, which may arise spontaneously
or hereditarily or be transferred from another animal.
