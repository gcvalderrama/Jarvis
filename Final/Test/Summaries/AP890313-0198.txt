Twelve million Americans have some form of diabetes.  Hispanics are
three times as likely to develop diabetes as the general population.
San Antonio, 50 percent Hispanic in population, is becoming the base
for diabetes studies.  Type II, the most common form, develops mostly
in obese adults over 40 who may also have a family history of the
disease.  Researchers believe that poor Hispanics' diets of cheap
processed food, lack of exercise, and infrequent medical attention
increases their risk of acquiring diabetes.  Researchers are using an
anti-diabetic drug metaforim, used successfully outside the US, which
may have FDA approval soon.
