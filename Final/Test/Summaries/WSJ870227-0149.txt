The nation's governors met this week to discuss welfare reform.  They
want to see the current income-maintenance system changed to a
job-support system requiring able-bodied recipients to work for
benefits. The goal: to move recipients into jobs and off the rolls.

Several states have launched similar systems; results are promising.

Meeting with Clinton, they found some areas of agreement.  However,
the governors' plan would increase welfare costs by two billion
dollars, which they view as an investment.  Congress and the
president, however, are unlikely to endorse a plan that would raise
the deficit.
