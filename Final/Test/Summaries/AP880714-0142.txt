The drought plaguing much of the nation has shifted eastward but
little relief is in sight for most areas.  The forecast through next
Monday calls for hot, dry weather eastward from the Rockies through
the Ohio Valley to the Mid-Atlantic.  A 30-day weather forecast last
Wednesday held little hope for improvement.  At the beginning of July,
29% of the nation was undergoing severe or extreme drought.
Nationally, the drought is about equivalent to that of 1911 but is
less severe than in the 1930s or 1956.  In the Midwest, however, large
areas have experienced the driest April-June period since 1895.
