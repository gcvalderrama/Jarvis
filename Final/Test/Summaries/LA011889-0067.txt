On January 18, 1989, the Los Angeles County district attorney's office
was investigating a videotaped account of a Long Beach white policeman
shoving a black man's head and arm through a glass window after a
traffic stop.  The incident happened on 14 January 1989.

The arrested black man was Sgt. Don Jackson of the Hawthorne police
force.  He and a companion, federal corrections officer Jeff Hull,
dressed in shabby clothes and in an old car, set up a sting operation
to prove the abuse of minorities by Long Beach police.  The sting
apparently worked well.  The incident was covered by a van with a
television news team.
