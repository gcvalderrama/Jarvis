Shining Path guerrillas dominate the Upper Huallaga Valley with their
own "revolutionary justice".  They banned drug abuse, prostitution,
homosexuality and thievery.  They exhibit an almost puritanical
honesty; they pay for what they take and return what they borrow.  A
Roman Catholic priest says "in a sense they enforce a hyper-Christian
morality-except they kill you if you break the rules".  The guerrillas
prohibit drug consumption, but defend coca production as an important
income source for the peasants so long as the coca paste is shipped
out of the country.  When the government police came to wipe out coca
production, they mistreated the peasants, robbing and raping.
