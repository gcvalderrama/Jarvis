The record $3.9 billion drought relief program of 1988 became an
unexpected election-year windfall for thousands of farmers who
collected millions of dollars for nature's normal quirks.  An
Associated Press study found the relief bill paid cash to farmers far
beyond original intent to save farmers from bankruptcy.  The program
broadened at each step, adding hail, flood, heat, insect, wind, and
fungus damage.  None of the conditions should have been ruled
eligible.  Loose regulations and lax enforcement were the major
reasons for Government generosity.  Also, it was noted that
politicians were trying to be recognized in an election year as
friends of agriculture.
