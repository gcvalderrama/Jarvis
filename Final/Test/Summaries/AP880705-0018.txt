Rainfall helped firefighters control wildfires in Wyoming's Shoshone
National Forest and Yellowstone National Park, and in California's
Yosemite National Park over the weekend.  Four firefighting crews were
expected from Colorado, Utah and South Dakota to reinforce
firefighters in Wyoming.  At Yellowstone, firefighters reported the
fires 90 percent contained by Monday.  The cause of a fire in nearby
Stanislaus National Forest was a "bottle rocket".  A fire in
Michigan's Hiawatha National Forest was brought under control Monday.
The Fourth of July was no holiday for firefighters from national
forests in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Idaho and other states who were
shipped to Michigan.
