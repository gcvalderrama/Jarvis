Tornadoes can occur any month but are more frequent April through
June, between 3 and 6pm. The thunderstorm portion adjacent to large
hail is most likely to produce tornadoes.  Tornadoes mostly travel
northeast but can stand still or spiral erratically. Average speed is
30 mph but can reach 70. Violent tornadoes (less than 2%) have wind
speeds over 200 mph and a 26-mile long path. The longest tornado on
record went 219 miles across Missouri, Illinois and Indiana in March
1925. The largest outbreak was in April 1974 when 148 storms killed
300 people in 13 states over two days.
