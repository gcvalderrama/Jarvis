Members of the international Organization for Economic Co-operation
and Development worry that increasing costs of welfare and social
programs are adding to the nations' budget deficits and state
borrowing.  As the populations age in the future, the situation will
likely worsen.

Some of the factors qt work are higher pension costs, more healthcare
benefits and increasing longevity.  Many nations have universal
healthcare coverage and high unemployment rates.

Some solutions suggested are: raising the retirement age, lowering
benefits, a flat-rate pension and increased contributions.

Combined with social changes - more one-parent families and the
decline of the extended family - increased geriatric services and
welfare will be necessary.
