Two USAF F-16 Fighter jets from the 50th Tactical Fighter Wing at Hahn
AFB crashed in the air while on a training mission at 1:30 pm today
six miles south of Mainz. One F- 16 rammed the other from behind and
both exploded on impact. One pilot was killed and the other ejected
safely. They crashed near a populated area but no one on the ground
was hurt.

At noon today, 90 miles away, an F-16 from the 52nd Tactical Fighter
Wing at Spangdahlen AFB crashed into the Black Forest while taking
part in a NATO exercise.  That pilot ejected safely.
