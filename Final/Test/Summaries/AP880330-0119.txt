The Census Bureau is under pressure from two groups to make changes in
the way it conducts the 1990 count.  One group wants to exclude
illegal aliens.  Another group wants to include people who may be
overlooked, specifically, blacks and Hispanics living in urban areas.
Experts with the independent Population Reference Bureau believe that
the results from doing both would almost balance each other out.  The
only shift in House seats from these counting changes would be that
California will get one less seat and Georgia one more.  Continuing a
decades long trend, the Northeast and Midwest will lose seats
regardless.
