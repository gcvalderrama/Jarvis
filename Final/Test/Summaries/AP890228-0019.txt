Earthquake deaths in 1988 were the highest since 1976.  An Armenian
quake killed 25,000.  Other quakes in the Soviet Union, and on the
borders of India and Nepal, and China and Burma accounted for another
2,000 deaths.  The Armenian quake had a magnitude of 6.8.  An
earthquake is considered significant if its magnitude is 6.5.
Overall, 61 quakes fell in this category in 1988, 15 fewer than the
year before.  Three significant earthquakes were recorded in the US,
one of magnitude 7.6 in the Gulf of Alaska, but only minor damage
resulted.  Japan, usually seismically active had only one significant
quake, causing only minor injuries.
