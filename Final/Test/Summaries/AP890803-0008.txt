Hurricane Dean, the season's second, rumbled through the Carribbean
today, threatening the Leewards, U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.
Residents were warned to prepare emergency supplies and secure
property.  Winds were clocked at 80 miles per hour.
  
Puerto Ricans crowded supermarkets and the Governor's windows were
boarded.  Forecasters expect Dean to make land in the Leewards, and in
the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico 24-36 hours later.
  
Hurricane specialist Jim Gross called Dean a small hurricane;
nevertheless, rainfall of four to eight inches and tides two to four
feet above normal are possible.

Allison, Barry and Chantal preceded Dean as named storms this
season.
