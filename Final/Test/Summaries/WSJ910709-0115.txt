Former Reagan and Bush speech writer Peggy Noonan suggests that
Supreme Court nominee is living proof that in America anything is
possible.  He overcame humble beginnings and made it in America
because he was loved.  His triumph declares that a good man of
whatever color can rise in this country without the active assistance
of the state.  Ms Noonan hopes that the administration will go
straight to the people and present the mother, grandmother, and nuns
that helped open his eyes.  She also hopes that the administration
will demonstrate moral confidence in its choice and not become
defensive.
