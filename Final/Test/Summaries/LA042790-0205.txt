Elizabeth Taylor always draws intense scrutiny, especially when she is
ill.  Her current bout with pneumonia has drawn another flurry of
interest as she recovers at St. John's Hospital with her four children
in attendance.

At a press conference Wednesday, her doctors denied that she has
either AIDS or cancer.
  
Her life has been one of extremes: great career success and fame but
seven failed marriages and bouts of poor health.

However, she has exhibited bravery and candor as she battled back
problems, operations, bronchitis, pneumonia, and addictions to pain
and sleep medications, food and alcohol.
