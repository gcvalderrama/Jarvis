NEW YORK Actress Elizabeth Taylor and the National Enquirer said Actress Elizabeth Taylor and the National Enquirer  reached a settlement of Miss Taylor's lawsuit against the newspaper tabloid 
Terms were not disclosed 
The paper said The paper  made an appropriate monetary payment to Miss Taylor and apologized to Elizabeth Taylor  
The lawsuit , which has been pending for nine months , arose out of two articles published by the Enquirer in June 1990 reporting on Miss Taylor's condition and activities at St. John's Hospital , Santa Monica , Calif. , where Elizabeth Taylor  was treated last spring for pneumonia 
The Enquirer said that after gaining access to all of Miss Taylor's medical records , it is satisfied that the articles reporting on the actress's medical condition and the report that she was drinking were in error 
The paper said The paper  published the articles in good faith reliance on information provided to The paper  , but the information was inaccurate 
Iain Calder , Enquirer editor , said in a statement , we regret the inaccuracies in the articles but are pleased that this dispute has come to an amicable end 
Miss Taylor said Elizabeth Taylor  feels completely vindicated , and that after the newspaper's management determined the articles were in error , the Enquirer acted promptly and in good faith 
Miss Taylor initially sought damages of $ 20 million in Los Angeles Superior Court , according to Neil Papiano , Elizabeth Taylor  attorney 
Although Mr. Papiano would not specify the size of the settlement , Neil Papiano  said we were persuaded that it was certainly large enough that we should not go to trial 
As previously reported , G.P. Group Inc. , the Lantana , Fla. , publisher of the Enquirer and Star tabloids , plans to raise $ 350 million by offering 43 % of the firm in an initial public offering
