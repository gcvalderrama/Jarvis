Over the past two years , the Ventura County district attorney's office in four separate incidents has declined to prosecute suspects who contended that victims of police brutality  were victims of police brutality while being arrested for various offenses by Oxnard officers , records show 
In a fifth and more recent incident , the district attorney's office declined to file a charge of assaulting an officer against an Oxnard man who says an Oxnard man  and several other guests at a June 15 private party were beaten by Oxnard police 
Instead , Anthony Flores , 22 , was charged with five misdemeanor counts of resisting arrest 
The men involved in three of the five incidents have filed police brutality lawsuits against the city , the department or the police officers involved 
The suits , which seek unspecified damages and medical and legal expenses , are pending 
Two of the incidents have led to an investigation by the Police Department's internal affairs division 
Deputy Dist 
Atty. Edward Brodie , misdemeanor supervisor for the office , said the decisions not to prosecute the suspects do not necessarily mean that Oxnard police were not justified in making the arrests 
In each of the four cases , Brodie said , his office did not prosecute because it found that police did not provide enough evidence to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt 
But Jean Farley , a supervisor for the Ventura County public defender's office , said the Ventura County public defender's office  is extremely rare for the district attorney's office not to prosecute a suspect who is accused by police 
The district attorney's office may have declined to prosecute the suspects because police brutality has been alleged , Police  said 
Prosecution is usually turned down when the arresting officer is suspected of using excessive force , Police  said 
Assistant Police Chief William Kady declined to discuss the brutality allegations against the Oxnard officers because of pending litigation 
Assistant Police Chief William Kady  said , however , that the decisions by the district attorney's office not to prosecute the suspects do not reflect poorly on the department 
Assistant Police Chief William Kady  do not think the suspects  reputation is any worse than any other department's , Assistant Police Chief William Kady  said 
There is always going to be a disagreement over how much force is used 
The latest incident involving an accusation of police brutality stemmed from the June 15 clash between 18 officers and about 12 party guests at a house in the 1300 block of South E Street 
The latest incident involving an accusation of police brutality  began when four officers answered complaints about a loud party 
A police report said Flores started the fight by shoving a policeman 
Flores and his brothers , Alex , 19 , and Luis Jr. , 24 all of whom suffered gashes and scrapes on Flores and his brothers  heads and bodies said the officers beat four officers  without provocation 
Police had arrested Flores on suspicion of assaulting an officer and of resisting arrest but the district attorney's office decided two weeks later to prosecute Flores on the five misdemeanor counts of resisting arrest 
Based upon Deputy Dist  review of all the reports , the charges were the most appropriate charges to file , said Deputy Dist 
Atty. Donald Gran , who declined to elaborate 
Police Chief Robert Owens has ordered an investigation into the incident 
In an incident April 7 , Sergio E. Gonzalez , 19 , accused Oxnard officers of ordering a police dog to attack Sergio E. Gonzalez  before Sergio E. Gonzalez  was arrested 
In a suit filed June 29 , Gonzalez said Sergio E. Gonzalez  was standing on Sunkist Circle when the dog attacked a police dog  , biting a police dog  on the arm and left shoulder 
Gonzalez was taken to St. John's Regional Medical Center , where Sergio E. Gonzalez  underwent surgery and spent two weeks recovering from Sergio E. Gonzalez  injuries 
Edward M. Fox , an attorney representing Gonzalez , said his client , a gardener , might suffer some permanent injury to his client  right arm 
According to a police report filed by Officer Michael Cole , police were sent to a parking lot outside the Oxnard Moose Lodge to investigate a report of an altercation between several men after a wedding reception 
Cole's report said Gonzalez was found hiding in the parking lot and was bit by a police service dog during the arrest 
The report , however , does not say why the dog attacked Gonzalez or whether Gonzalez resisted arrest 
Police arrested Gonzalez on suspicion of disturbing the peace , Brodie said 
But the district attorney's office declined to file any charges because the police report failed to show that Gonzalez was involved in the altercation , Brodie said 
Fox said Gonzalez did not attend the wedding but was visiting a friend nearby and went to the parking lot to find out what was causing the commotion 
In a third incident , Louis M. Cornett , a retired teacher and licensed gun dealer , said Louis M. Cornett  was beaten on Oct. 20 while in custody at Oxnard police headquarters 
Cornett said the altercation began as Louis M. Cornett  was returning home after scouting out a site for quail hunting near Santa Maria 
Officer Robert Camarillo said in a police report that Cornett was arrested in the 3600 block of Taffrail Road on suspicion of brandishing a weapon , resisting arrest and possessing a loaded firearm 
Camarillo said in the report that Officer Robert Camarillo  stopped Cornett while investigating a complaint of a man waving a gun from a car and threatening youngsters packed into another vehicle 
Camarillo said Cornett fit the description of the man who allegedly brandished the weapon 
When Officer Robert Camarillo  searched Cornett's car , Camarillo said , Officer Robert Camarillo  found a semiautomatic handgun , several rounds of ammunition and a 12-gauge shotgun 
Camarillo admitted that Officer Robert Camarillo  later shoved Cornett against a wall at police headquarters because the suspect had struggled and had clenched Officer Robert Camarillo  fists in a threatening manner 
But a lawsuit against Camarillo filed May 8 , 1989 , alleges that while in custody at the police station , Camarillo shoved and punched Cornett in the mouth 
Officer Robert Camarillo  slammed Louis M. Cornett  in the mouth once , twice and a third time , Cornett said in an interview 
Cornett , maintaining that Louis M. Cornett  never struggled with the officer , said Louis M. Cornett  suffered a broken tooth and a cut lip during the beating 
The district attorney's office declined to file charges against Cornett because , Brodie said , there was insufficient evidence to prove that Cornett brandished a gun 
In a fourth incident , Alejandro Guzman-Flores , 21 , accused three Oxnard officers of beating him on his face , causing severe damage to Alejandro Guzman-Flores  eyesight 
Guzman-Flores said Alejandro Guzman-Flores  was working in a motorcycle repair shop on Jan. 27 , 1989 , when his boss asked his boss  to investigate a noise in the alley behind the shop in the 1500 block of South Pine Street 
In a suit filed against the city Nov. 14 , 1989 , the Police Department and officers Jana Younger , Fred Sedillos and James Struck , Guzman-Flores contends that James Struck  was grabbed from behind by Younger while in the alley 
The officer poked an officer  with a baton and questioned an officer  about a car parked nearby , Guzman-Flores said in the suit 
The Police Department declined to release Floresarrest report because , police officials said , the Police Department's  contains Anthony Flores  criminal history 
But Floreslawyer , Sherrie L. McCracken , said the report states that officers were at the shop responding to a complaint of a man with a gun 
McCracken said the officers continued to question Flores in English , but Flores a recent immigrant from Mexico who speaks only Spanish could not respond 
Flores was handcuffed and shoved to the ground , causing Sedillos to trip and fall on Anthony Flores  , according to the suit 
Sedillos got up and punched and kicked Flores several times while Younger held Flores in a choke-hold , the suit alleges 
Flores was arrested on suspicion of resisting arrest and obstructing an officer 
The district attorney's office decided to prosecute Flores but later dismissed all charges during Florestrial because police failed to turn over a recording of a dispatcher's call requesting that officers investigate the incident at the motorcycle shop , McCracken said 
McCracken said Flores never struggled with the officers until after Anthony Flores  was placed in the choke-hold 
McCracken said Flores was beaten so severely that Anthony Flores  suffered a detached retina and might lose partial sight in one eye 
four officers  essentially beat the hell out of Sherrie L. McCracken  for nothing , a choke-hold  said 
In another incident , Luis C. Luna , 50 , alleges in a complaint filed with the city on June 27 , 1989 , that he was beaten by three officers near a restaurant in Port Hueneme 
Luna said in an interview that Luis C. Luna  , Luis C. Luna  wife and several friends were leaving the restaurant on July 16 , 1988 , when an Oxnard police car pulled up in front of the group 
Luna , a public works inspector for the city of Port Hueneme , said Luis C. Luna  walked up to the police car and asked Officer Peter Ruggiero in a kidding manner what Luis C. Luna  was doing in Port Hueneme 
The officer jumped out and started pushing Luis C. Luna  back against the pillar in front of the building , using an officer  baton on Luis C. Luna  throat , Luna said in the complaint 
When an officer  asked the officer why an officer  was being shoved , Ruggiero told an officer  that an officer  was under arrest , according to the complaint 
Officers Steven Vendt and Humberto Jimenez were called to assist Ruggiero , the complaint said 
Officers Steven Vendt and Humberto Jimenez  used forcible brutality by hitting Luis C. Luna  with the baton on Luis C. Luna  elbow , knees and back , forcing Luis C. Luna  to drop down on the sidewalk with Luis C. Luna  face slammed against the pavement , Luna said in the complaint 
Luna was arrested on suspicion of disorderly conduct under the influence of drugs 
The district attorney's office decided to prosecute Luna , but in September , 1988 before the Ventura County district attorney's  trial began all charges against the Ventura County district attorney's  were withdrawn for lack of evidence , Brodie said 
Owens ordered the department's internal affairs division to investigate Luna's complaint 
But Luna said the Police Department later sent Luis C. Luna  a letter saying the investigation revealed no wrongdoing on the officersparts 
Luna had asked the city for $ 50,000 for medical expenses and to compensate for humiliation suffered in public 
Luis C. Luna  failed , however , to submit the claim for damages during the statutory six-month period after the incident and was barred by law from filing a lawsuit
