While more than a thousand runners were treated to an evening of comedy , music and magic at Saturday night's carbo load dinner on Mission Bay , Ernesto Beatriz Martinez of Mexico City was treated to a bumpy 12Â 1/2 - hour bus ride from his hometown to border town Tijuana 
Not until early Sunday morning did Beatriz Martinez , 29 , cross the U.S. / Mexican border to register for , then reach the starting line of , the San Diego International Marathon on East Mission Bay Drive 
His recovery was simply amazing 
Two hours , 16 minutes and 12 seconds later , in only his second marathon his first was this event last year when he finished eighth Beatriz Martinez crossed the finish line 39 seconds ahead of South African Mark Plaatjes , now of Lake Forest , Ill. 
I was not 100 % sure I would win , he said through an interpreter , but I had much confidence that I would do well 
I was well prepared 
Marie Rollins , a member of the 1988 Irish Olympic team and now of Glendale , kicked Marathon Notes Marie Rollins race up a gear after the 16th mile and won the women's race in 2:39:05 , handily defeating hometown favorite Mindy Ireland (2:42:18 )of Escondido 
It was the first marathon Rollins has completed this year , after dropping out of the New York City Marathon four weeks ago in mile 18 because of stomach cramps 
The main thing was to feel the best Marathon Notes Marie Rollins could , said Rollins , 30 
Marathon Notes Marie Rollins went out real conservative , Marathon Notes Marie Rollins ran my own race and my own race  paid off 
Indeed my own race  did 
Beatriz Martinez and Rollins received $ 5,000 each for Beatriz Martinez , 29  victories 
And for Beatriz Martinez , who ran cross country for San Diego City College in 1988 , he might as well have won the lottery 
This was a man who earlier this week was running in tattered shoes and had a TV raffled in his honor to raise the $ 180 required to cover transportation , the entrance fee and other expenses 
Beatriz Martinez , 29  want to help Beatriz Martinez , 29  family and friends who raised the money for Beatriz Martinez , 29  , said Beatriz Martinez , a school teacher in Mexico City 
My family , My family  are very poor 
Plaatjes and Ireland took home $ 2,500 each , and Maurilio Castillo (2:18:06 )of Naucalpan , Mexico , the men's third place finisher , and Great Britian's Gillian Horovitz (2:43:20 ), now of New York City , third in the women's race , received $ 1,500 
Doug Kurtis of Detroit was successful in Doug Kurtis of Detroit  bid to run Doug Kurtis of Detroit  12th marathon in a calendar year under 2 hours , 20 minutes 
Doug Kurtis of Detroit  2:18:16 finish set a world record 
Kurtis was originally awarded third place , but miscommunication somewhere along the 26.2-mile course gave Castillo third in Maurilio Castillo (2:18:06 )of Naucalpan , Mexico , the men's third place finisher , and Great Britian's Gillian Horovitz (2:43:20 ), now of New York City  first marathon and moved Kurtis to fourth 
Castillo was entered in the accompanying half marathon , but Maurilio Castillo (2:18:06 )of Naucalpan , Mexico , the men's third place finisher , and Great Britian's Gillian Horovitz (2:43:20 ), now of New York City  and Pedro Casillas missed that racesturn at just over the mile mark and mistakenly followed the longer route 
According to Dr. Bill Burke , co-owner of the marathon , Castillo was told several times that Bill Burke  was running the marathon course , but Bill Burke  decided to continue 
Maurilio Castillo (2:18:06 )of Naucalpan , Mexico , the men's third place finisher , and Great Britian's Gillian Horovitz (2:43:20 ), now of New York City  traveled too much to get here to go home and say Maurilio Castillo (2:18:06 )of Naucalpan , Mexico , the men's third place finisher , and Great Britian's Gillian Horovitz (2:43:20 ), now of New York City  went the wrong way , Castillo said , also using an interpreter 
There was some question that Castillo had not finished the entire race as reporters and photographers on the lead vehicle did not see him for several miles 
But Plaatjes said some question that Castillo had not  was because Mark Plaatjes  and Casillas , who eventually dropped out at mile 18 , were so far ahead of the lead pack of Plaatjes , Danny Bustos , Dick LeDoux , Kurtis and Leodigard Martin 
as reporters and photographers on the lead vehicle did not see him for several miles  saw them way ahead of as reporters and photographers on the lead vehicle did not see him for several miles  , said Plaatjes 
Mark Plaatjes  told them (Bustos , LeDoux and Martin )not to worry about Mark Plaatjes  , Mark Plaatjes  am not racing , but they better go catch the other guys 
The first time as reporters and photographers on the lead vehicle did not see him for several miles  caught them was at 18 miles 
Said Burke : Mark Plaatjes  position is that Danny Bustos  paid the same fee , Danny Bustos  ran the same race and Danny Bustos  finished the race 
Although the city did not allow any vehicles on the course from miles 18-22 , Burke said cameras would verify that Bill Burke  did cover the complete distance 
Bustos of Las Vegas , N.M. , led for the first 14 miles , followed closely by Plaatjes , Beatriz Martinez and LeDoux 
But Beatriz Martinez took the lead at 23 miles and Plaatjes could not close the gap 
Rollins and Ireland ran together for 11 miles until Kathy Smith of Irvine took the lead for miles 12-17 
Rollins reeled Smith in gradually and took the lead for the remainder
