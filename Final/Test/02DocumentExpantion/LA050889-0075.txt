Patience is often difficult to muster for those who run the 26.2 miles of a marathon 
The tendency is to want to finish the race as soon as possible and get a head start on recovering from the race  
Patience was The tendency  own virtue in the Long Beach Marathon Sunday , as the men's and women's winners shrewdly waited for others to make mistakes and for the sun which was obscured by cloud cover early in the race to burn through and take a toll on the runners 
Rex Wilson of New Zealand patiently waited for the lead pack to sort New Zealand  out , took the lead at 10 miles and rolled to a victory in 2 hours 12 minutes 27 seconds , a course record 
The old record of 2:13:22 was set in 1986 by Ric Sayre 
Among the women , the race played the race  out in a calm , if not orderly , fashion 
Wen Yanmin , a 23-year-old student from Bejing , China , picked her way through a strung-out pack and out-kicked Laura Konatz of Toronto to win in 2:43:33 , also a course record 
Yanmin broke the old record of 2:44:51 set last year by Dianne Rodgers 
Robert Molinatti of Huntington Beach won the wheelchair division in 1:47:59 
Run as a race within a race was the Pacific Rim Marathon , which consists of teams from invited countries 
Wilson and Yanmin won both the Long Beach Marathon and the Pacific Rim race , for total prize money of $ 9,500 each 
Conditions were excellent at the start of the race , which had its largest-ever field of 4,021 entrants 
The weather for the first 1Â 1/2 hours was cloudy and cool 
But the mist burned off and the last eight miles the toughest portion of the marathon became even tougher 
The refrain from the runners was , The refrain from the runners  is not the heat , The refrain from the runners  is the humidity 
The men's race was led at various times by a pack of about six runners 
One by one the men's  fell victim to the weather or other equally debilitating elements 
Viktor Gural of the Soviet Union , who had been among the leaders for most of the race , said Viktor Gural of the Soviet Union , who had been among the leaders for most of the race  had trouble with everything 
Gural emphatically said Soviet Union  was too hot , The sun went to work , was how Viktor Gural of the Soviet Union , who had been among the leaders for most of the race  put Soviet Union  , and Viktor Gural of the Soviet Union , who had been among the leaders for most of the race  said Viktor Gural of the Soviet Union , who had been among the leaders for most of the race  experienced tenderness in Viktor Gural of the Soviet Union , who had been among the leaders for most of the race  liver during the race 
American food also did not agree with Gural Viktor Gural of the Soviet Union , who had been among the leaders for most of the race  stomach was upset 
Viktor Gural of the Soviet Union , who had been among the leaders for most of the race  dropped from third to fifth in the race's final stages 
Samson Obwocha , a Kenyan who lives in Gardena , waited for Gural to fade and then made Samson Obwocha  move 
Samson Obwocha  saw him struggling and Samson Obwocha  knew Samson Obwocha  could outkick him , Obwocha said 
Samson Obwocha  did , and finished fourth in 2:28.08 
Wilson also made a move , or more precisely , Wilson  continued Wilson  steady 5:03 mile pace while the rest of the field slowed from the early , faster pace 
Wilson  did not really want to lead all the way , Wilson said 
But Wilson  wanted to run at 5-minute pace , so Wilson  had to lead 
The strategy resulted in a personal best time in only Wilson  third marathon an event Wilson  dislikes 
Wilson  hate the marathon , Wilson , 28 , said , sounding quite sensible 
At 21 miles Wilson  started to hurt 
Wilson  legs were getting tired , Wilson  quads were getting tight 
Those little bridges at the end were like mountains 
Still , Wilson built a healthy lead on those mountains in Belmont Shores 
Tomio Bueyoshi of Japan was second in 2:15:31 and Liu Wenzun of China was third in 2:19:16 
Yanmin had to come from behind for her victory , giving the women's race an exciting finish 
As happened in the men's race , the runners in the lead pack ebbed and eventually faded 
Guadalupe Roman of Mexico led through much of the race but lost ground steadily in the last five miles and finished sixth 
Two Soviet runners Irina Ruban and Tatiana Zueva who had run side-by-side in third and fourth place throughout the race , faded 
Neither placed in the top 50 
It fell to Konatz , who had been in first and second throughout the race , to hang in there 
Even as the Chinese runner was bearing down on out-kicked Laura Konatz of Toronto  as the finish line came into sight 
Konatz was happy with out-kicked Laura Konatz of Toronto  second place time of 2:43:50 
Asked if out-kicked Laura Konatz of Toronto  was ever aware of Yanmin during the race , Konatz laughed 
The marathon is an unpredictable event , out-kicked Laura Konatz of Toronto  said 
out-kicked Laura Konatz of Toronto  knew at 25 miles if someone had a good kick ...
