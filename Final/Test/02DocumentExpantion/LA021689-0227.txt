Ben Johnson's personal physician has said the disgraced Olympic sprinter took a banned steroid on one occasion four months before the Seoul Olympics last year , the Toronto Star newspaper reported today 
Dr. Jamie Astaphan , in a telephone interview from the Caribbean island of St. Kitts , said Johnson was depressed last May by a hamstring injury that threatened to end Ben Johnson's  rivalry against Carl Lewis for the 100 meters Olympics gold medal 
Dr. Jamie Astaphan  bought stanozolol or somebody bought the Caribbean island of St. Kitts  for Ben Johnson's  in Toronto , Astaphan told the newspaper 
But immediately after taking the Caribbean island of St. Kitts  Johnson suffered violent muscle spasms 
Ben Johnson's  was immediately brought to Dr. Jamie Astaphan  and Dr. Jamie Astaphan  nursed Ben Johnson's  back to top condition , Dr. Jamie Astaphan  said 
Astaphan said Johnson was not on stanozolol when Ben Johnson's  beat Lewis in a world-record time of 9.79 seconds for the 100 meters gold , a medal taken away from Ben Johnson's  when Ben Johnson's  then tested positive for stanozolol use by Olympics officials 
Asked how Jamie Astaphan  could be certain , Astaphan replied : Jamie Astaphan  must admit that even though Jamie Astaphan  am Ben Johnson's  personal physician , there is no way I can keep a constant check on him 
But no way I can keep a constant check on him  would not make any sense for an athlete to go back on a drug which a few months previously could have ruined Ben Johnson's  for life 
Johnson has said Ben Johnson's  never knowingly took performance-enhancing drugs 
Astaphan has denied Jamie Astaphan  ever prescribed such drugs to Johnson or other athletes on Canada's Olympics team 
The Johnson scandal prompted Canada to call an inquiry into drug use in amateur sport that resumes hearings in Toronto next Wednesday 
Commission counsel Robert Armstrong said it was totally irresponsible that Dr. Astaphan made such statements outside of the commission and not under oath where Johnson or other athletes  are available to be tested by cross-examination
