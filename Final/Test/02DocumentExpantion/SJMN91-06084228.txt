St. Martin's , 306 pp. , $ 18.95 ; CHARLIE Francis , testifying in 1988 in Toronto at a federal inquiry about the use of performance-enhancing drugs in sports , seemed a mad scientist , something on the order of Dr. Frankenstein 
Francis , the Canadian national sprint coach , knew the polysyllabic names and complex characteristics of steroids furazabol , stanozolol , Dianabol as if family members  were members of CHARLIE Francis  family 
And although CHARLIE Francis  spoke of his athletes as if family members  were family members , too , CHARLIE Francis  made furazabol , stanozolol , Dianabol  plain , under oath , that CHARLIE Francis  had given family members  every steroid combination imaginable , CHARLIE Francis  experiments all carefully calibrated , charted and analyzed. ; CHARLIE Francis  system had worked remarkably 
On Sept. 24 , 1988 , Francis most famous pupil , Ben Johnson , who immigrated to Toronto from Jamaica as a scrawny 14-year-old , ran 100 meters in 9.79 seconds at the Olympics in Seoul , South Korea 
The time was a world record and gave Johnson the gold medal , ahead of the defending champion , U.S. star Carl Lewis. ; But the Francis system , like all systems , was not foolproof 
About 42 hours after CHARLIE Francis  life's greatest moment , Francis writes on the first page of CHARLIE Francis  confessional , Speed Trap , his nightmare began 
; Johnson , the world's fastest man , had tested positive for illegal steroid use 
Suddenly Ben Johnson  was the world's fastest cheat 
Millions of dollars worth of endorsements shriveled up 
Ben Johnson  gold medal was revoked , and Ben Johnson  world record was , too. ; Because Johnson was caught , the Canadians were embarrassed 
Because Millions of dollars worth of endorsements  were embarrassed , Millions of dollars worth of endorsements  conducted a federal inquiry 
Because Millions of dollars worth of endorsements  held an inquiry , Francis had to testify 
And because of that testimony , we have Speed Trap , an elaboration of what Francis said at the inquiry and a history of CHARLIE Francis  remarkable path through the world of track and field. ; CHARLIE Francis  argues , essentially , that to be a world-class sprinter , you must use steroids CHARLIE Francis  makes this argument even as Johnson attempts a comeback for the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona , Spain , without them. ; Steroids do not make a runner run faster , Francis explains , but Millions of dollars worth of endorsements  enable a runner to train harder 
The desire for speed comes with incredible costs , and Millions of dollars worth of endorsements  are the trap 
By encouraging CHARLIE Francis  athletes to use steroids and Francis maintains that his athletes  all wanted to do so and knew about steroids before the coach brought the subject up Francis argues that CHARLIE Francis  is simply helping to create a level playing field. ; We learn that the use of performance-enhancing drugs is nothing new in the world of sports that cocaine and arsenic and codeine were used by athletes in the 1896 Olympic Games 
We learn that Johnson harmed Ben Johnson  own world-record times by raising his hand jubilantly as Ben Johnson  approached the finish line 
We learn that if athletes take steroids on his athletes  own , independent of an official (but still illicit , of course )program , an official (but still illicit , of course )program  is called free-lancing 
That is one of Francistheories for why Johnson got caught. ; But , Francis says , there is no logical reason for Johnson to have been caught 
After all , Ben Johnson  had never been caught before 
No one of Johnson's standing had been caught before 
Francis offers theories for the positive test result free-lancing , sabotage , a screw-up by the team doctor but there is no clear answer. ; For all the positive test result  candor , answers and revelations are not forthcoming in Speed Trap 
Francis , without naming names , convinces us that steroid usage is rampant , but CHARLIE Francis  tells us what that means to CHARLIE Francis  only in a technical sense 
The book lacks a strong sense of character development 
The book  does not take any moral stand ; The book  lacks passion 
How did Francis feel violating the rules ? 
What drove CHARLIE Francis  ? 
What did CHARLIE Francis  really feel toward Johnson ? 
; After a two-year ban , Johnson is running again without Franciscoaching 
The early word is that Ben Johnson  is still extremely fast , probably one of the fastest men in the world but no longer the fastest 
Francis would have us believe that without steroids , Johnson can not be the fastest 
(Johnson disagrees )
; At the end of Speed Trap , Francis says that steroids can not be simply banned their use is too prevalent , they can be disguised too easily and they work too well 
The dangers have been exaggerated , Francis says 
People who want running to be a natural sport are naive 
People who want running to be a natural sport  ceased being natural ages ago , the moment People who want running to be a natural sport  stopped running barefoot on dirt paths , Francis writes 
It is a formidable challenge to distinguish between nature and artifice , a task CHARLIE Francis  would leave to the philosophers 
; But Speed Trap left me wishing Francis had at least tried CHARLIE Francis  hand at philosophy 
Is not that everyone's responsibility ? 
To ask why the philosophers  do the things the philosophers  do ? 
But a sprint coach  was a sprint coach , and a sprint coach  had a different job , a sprint coach  concludes 
To help a few gifted people run as fast as a few gifted people  could 
; a few gifted people  ran fast , all right 
But a sprint coach  never seems to have asked a sprint coach  : Is it worth it ?
