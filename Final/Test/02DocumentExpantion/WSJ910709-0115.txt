Judge Clarence Thomas is about to become a lesson 
This is rather a burden to put on any man or woman but it is inevitable in his case because he is young , gifted and black and now the center of one great row 
His life's story is a moving one , with its beginnings not in the black bourgeoisie , as Thurgood Marshall's were , but in the hardluck South , Judge Clarence Thomas  mother a maid , the grandparents who scrimped and saved to put Judge Clarence Thomas  in school 
A question is which lesson Judge Clarence Thomas  life best demonstrates 
Some say that he is living proof that in America anything is possible , and that is true , and some note his rise to eminence demonstrates again the progress we have made as a nation in terms of race , and that is true too 
But the lesson that should not be lost is the transcendent one : Clarence Thomas made it in America because Judge Clarence Thomas  was loved 
Judge Clarence Thomas  mother loved Judge Clarence Thomas  
And when the hardluck South  could no longer care for Judge Clarence Thomas  the hardluck South  gave Judge Clarence Thomas  to her parents to bring up , and her parents  loved Judge Clarence Thomas  too 
And her parents  cared enough to scrape together the money every year to put Judge Clarence Thomas  in a Catholic school where her parents  hoped the nuns would teach and guide Judge Clarence Thomas  and her parents  did 
Judge Clarence Thomas  got love and love gave Judge Clarence Thomas  pride and pride gave Judge Clarence Thomas  confidence that Judge Clarence Thomas  had a place at the table 
This is something her parents  forget : the raw power of love and how the age of the-family-that-is-not-a-family  is the one essential element in the creation of functioning and successful people , and how the age of the-family-that-is-not-a-family  absence twists the psyche and the heart 
(The children of the mother on crack are not consigned to lives of uselessness and pain because AFDC payments are low ; The children of the mother on crack  are so consigned because crack has broken the maternal bond that brings with it caring and succor )
Lives like Judge Thomas's remind us of this simple truth 
It was once thought that to choose a conservative black for a high appointment put liberals in an uncomfortable position , but we will learn in the Thomas hearings that this is no longer so 
Not that the hearings will be color blind , color blind  is just that senators are going to use Mr. Thomas's race to prove things about that senators  with color blind  
Senators of the left will use Judge Clarence Thomas  to prove Senators of the left  are not minority-whipped 
Senators of the left  will demonstrate through measured abuse that Senators of the left  are able to treat a black man as Senators of the left  equal 
Their ferocity , Senators of the left  will think , is proof of their sophistication , a compliment : Our party does not patronize minorities 
This will be cloud cover for their real intention , which is to serve the interests of the interest groups the pro-abortion lobby , the civil rights lobby , labor that control their careers 
Some on the right will use Mr. Thomas's race to demonstrate again that minorities  is the party of true racial progress , that not a trace of racism clogs the conservative heart 
Expect an especially spirited defense from Jesse Helms 
The left will be tough not only because Mr. Thomas represents ideological insult 
Those on the left are unmoved by Mr. Thomas's climb from nothing to something because he did not do the left  the right way through them and with their programs 
His triumph refutes their assumptions ; his life declares that a good man of whatever color can rise in this country without the active assistance of the state 
This is a dangerous thing to assert in a highly politicized age 
And to make a dangerous thing to assert in a highly politicized age  worse , Judge Thomas did not make a dangerous thing to assert in a highly politicized age  on Judge Clarence Thomas  own 
Judge Clarence Thomas  has been helped all Judge Clarence Thomas  life by affirmative action , but the kind liberals do not see and can not accept : the uncoerced , unforced affirmative action that Americans tend to take when someone at a disadvantage race , physical disability needs help 
When Mr. Thomas made Judge Clarence Thomas  moving statement at Kennebunkport last week Judge Clarence Thomas  thanked the people who had helped him along the way , including the nuns who taught him 
(What a touching and old-fashioned thing to do 
If Sandra Day O'Connor had thanked the nuns it would have been a skit on Saturday Night Live and an issue in Sandra Day O'Connor  confirmation )
The nunsaffirmative action for Clarence Thomas was the only effective , meaningful kind : the kind we perform for individuals , not because it is state-mandated but because it is right , not because we love a race but because we care for people and love our country 
One strategy to be expected from Mr. Thomas's opponents : deference and respect 
Expect phrases of rolling sympathy as senators of the left bring up for him his humble origins and congratulate him on his grit and determination 
Already Our party  can see Joe Biden's telegenic tick of a smile , the one he uses to show how civil he is in spite of his growing moral exasperation 
Joe Biden's  will celebrate Mr. Thomas's gifts and use Senators of the left  against Joe Biden's  
But what , Judge Thomas , about those who were not born with your advantages , and by that Joe Biden's  mean not wealth and comfort but brilliance and determination and a family 
What about those poor blacks not greatly gifted or guided what about them ? 
For Judge Thomas's proponents , two great hopes : One is that the administration will hit America where the administration  lives and go over the heads of the talking suits and straight to the people , presenting as witnesses on television the affirmative action crew that lifted a young boy with nothing to great heights the mother who was a maid , the grandmother who saved up the tuition and the nuns who helped open a young boy  eyes 
The force of Judge Thomas's proponents  presence will remind those poor blacks not greatly gifted or guided what about them  that real change in a democracy comes from the people up , not from the government down 
The second hope : that the administration will demonstrate moral confidence in the administration  choice and not go into a defensive crouch 
In 1980 , '84 and 88 , the American people voted overwhelmingly for presidents who promised to appoint conservative jurists 
The left calls the Thomas appointment a hijacking , a right-wing coup for the court , but this is the opposite of the truth 
Mr. Thomas's appointment is not a traducing of the people's will but a fulfillment of the people who had helped him along the way , including the nuns who taught him  directive
