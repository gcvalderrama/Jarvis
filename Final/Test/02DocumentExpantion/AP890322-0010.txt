Allegations of police racism and brutality have shaken this city that for decades has prided itself on a progressive attitude toward civil rights and a reputation for racial harmony 
The deaths of two blacks at a drug raid that went awry , followed 10 days later by a scuffle between police and blacks at a downtown hotel , touched off an outcry by minority leaders for an outside review of the department 
It is like a watch spring 
You can only wind the watch so tightly before the watch  is going to snap 
Van Hayden  think two blacks at a drug raid that went awry  are approaching that breaking point , said Van Hayden , 25 , a student who says police beat Van Hayden  at the hotel 
The city's police chief , John Laux , says there is no reason to assume the department would be immune to a problem that is present in all segments of society 
The whole society to different degrees has problems of racism , John Laux  said 
In a letter to police supervisors in mid-February , Laux said : Let John Laux  make one thing perfectly clear _ any act of bias will be dealt with directly and severely 
There will be no tolerance for that type of inexcusable behavior 
Since former Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey , then a 35-year-old mayor running for the U.S. Senate , electrified the 1948 Democratic National Convention with Hubert H. Humphrey  historic speech in support of civil rights , Minneapolis has been viewed as a liberal , progressive city 
Some , including Hayden , say that image now blocks progress 
Van Hayden  think this city has to wake up 
Everyone always says , Van Hayden  ca not believe this is happening in Minnesota , in Minneapolis , the home of progressiveness 
That is real tricky , Hayden said 
If we get preoccupied with the image of the city , we are not going to be able to thoroughly address the problems we are facing 
The liberal image is a false picture , said Chris Nisan , a University of Minnesota student who has been involved in recent protests 
In a series of rallies in recent weeks , protesters demanded that officers involved in the drug raid be suspended , charges against those arrested at the hotel be dropped , and that a citizen police review board be established 
City Council voted last week to study the problem 
There are bad apples in every bunch and the Minneapolis Police Department is no exception , said Councilwoman Sayles Belton 
Councilwoman Sayles Belton  do not think protesters  (the good officers )are pleased with the few that are giving the good officers  the bad rap _ the spoilers 
Lloyd Smalley , 71 , and Lillian Weiss , 65 , were killed Jan. 25 in a fire that started after police hurled a stun grenade into Lloyd Smalley , 71 , and Lillian Weiss  apartment , where others also lived , during a drug raid 
No one conducting the raid knew the elderly people were living there , said Laux 
A grand jury decided not to bring charges against any officers , but an FBI investigation is continuing 
In the hotel scuffle , police said the elderly people  responsed to a call of a loud party 
Partygoers alleged that officers used the term nigger , and beat some of those arrested 
Laux said John Laux  officers have denied using racial names and said protesters lied about the number of people receiving medical attention following the arrests 
Gleason Glover , president of the Minneapolis Urban League , which works for interracial cooperation , said police racism has been a problem since Gleason Glover  took over the league position 21 years ago 
The matter of police misconduct and brutality has been going on for at least the 21 years Gleason Glover  have been here , but Gleason Glover  think the deaths pushed the issue beyond the point of tolerance that usually is the case in matters of police misconduct , Glover said 
There is deep resentment in both the black community and among police officers with regard to how police officers with regard  feel police officers with regard  are perceived by each other ... Gleason Glover  do not see a quick fix solution to a quick fix solution  , Glover said 
Allegations of police misconduct currently are reviewed by a panel appointed by the mayor 
The panel can only make recommendations 
Laux opposes establisment of a citizen panel to look into police actions 
The key point is that any time the head of the police department can not hire , fire or impose discipline , Gleason Glover  are no longer in charge , John Laux  said 
Laux said the 750-member department , which includes 62 minority members and 68 white women , will begin cultural awareness training for all officers , probably this fall 
62 minority members  need to get more education about 62 minority members  and about everyone else 
Our goal is to find out who can offer that to 62 minority members  and in what form , said Laux 
But Our goal  must be thoughtful and be done by the right people
