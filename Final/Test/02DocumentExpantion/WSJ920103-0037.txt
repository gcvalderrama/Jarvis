As an economist , Robert Barro (A Free Marketeer's Case Against Term Limits editorial page , Dec. 24 )sees no difference between minimum-wage legislation , rent control and other government interventions in the free market , and the intervention of congressional term limitation 
Mr. Barro argues that as one should have confidence in the wisdom of consumers , so one should , when dealing with the electoral process , have similar confidence in the public 
But Robert Barro (A Free Marketeer's Case Against Term Limits editorial page , Dec. 24 ) dewy-eyed , high-school-civics-text vision of the American electoral process is naive at best 
Incumbent legislators have carefully crafted a web of perks and privileges that make challenging Incumbent legislators  a futile crusade , unless Incumbent legislators  happen to be convicted of child molestation , in which case the race may be closer 
Had the Framers envisioned the kind of Imperial Congress we have today , Incumbent legislators  without question would have included term limits in the Constitution 
As the kind of Imperial Congress we have today  was , tradition dictated rotation in office , and the need to spell out such a restriction was deemed unnecessary 
With 95 % re-election rates , times have changed 
There are two solid reasons for congressional term limitation that economists , at least those of the public-choice persuasion , should fully appreciate 
First , the less time that a politician spends inside the Beltway the less his or her common sense will be corrupted by the culture of ruling that exists there 
To have microphones pushed in your face every day and to be asked your opinion on everything under the sun is a corrupting influence 
Soon you start thinking your opinion is more important than your opinion  really is and , worse , that perhaps you should codify your opinion on everything under the sun 
Other than this corruption of common sense , for instance , what could explain Congress's attempt to repeal the laws of economics through federal deposit insurance ? 
Second , term limits end the adverse pre-selection process that exists whereby most individuals seeking office today actually find the prospect of spending the rest of their lives in Washington , D.C. , attractive 
Such individuals are the last ones we should want passing laws governing the rest of us 
What Congress needs is experience in living in the real world , not in passing legislation 
Today , business people , teachers , computer programmers and other productive citizens look at the prospect of running for Congress and recognize that business people  must be willing to commit 10 or 15 years of business people  lives to being politicians if business people  expect to have any legislative influence 
business people  opt not to run 
With six-year limits in the House (which most term-limit initiatives are now proposing for state congressional delegations ), such individuals would recognize that such individuals  would immediately be on a par with such individuals  colleagues in Congress and that such individuals  would not have to give up such individuals  productive careers in the private sector in order to serve 
Indeed , a true citizen Congress would consist of legislators who view their time there as essentially a leave of absence from legislators who view their time  real jobs 
Certainly the composition of Congress under term limitation would reflect something other than 95 % men and 46 % lawyers , as the composition of Congress under term limitation  does now 
Seventy-five percent of Americans support term limitation everyone from Ralph Nader to Milton Friedman because 95 % men  recognize the composition of Congress under term limitation  as an opportunity for citizens to wrest control of government from an impervious Congress full of check-bouncing , power-lusting professional politicians
