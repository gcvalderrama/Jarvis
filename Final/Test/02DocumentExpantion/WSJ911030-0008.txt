The mood in the House majority leader's conference room darkened with each passing moment as leading Democratic congressmen heard one of their party is most prominent pollsters report what the public thought about leading Democratic congressmen  
The ostensible purpose of the recent session with Peter Hart was to discuss the public mood on campaign finance reform 
Mr. Hart and a Republican cohort , Douglas Bailey , conducted six focus groups in July in three states Illinois , Florida and Massachusetts to get a deeper feeling of public opinion 
But as Mr. Hart summarized Mr. Hart and a Republican cohort  findings , the discussion quickly centered on the dismay and disgust many voters feel about politics and government these days 
The reaction in the room was one of deep depression , according to one participant 
Another described it as combustible 
The Hart-Bailey report found the public downbeat about the way the country is going , convinced that Washington politicians are more concerned with political self-preservation than with the public good 
Average citizens , the pollsters found , believe Average citizens , the pollsters found  simply are not being heard in Washington , and more and more are losing confidence in the electoral system as a means of influencing government 
Accordingly , these politicians may be in real trouble this year 
The 1990 election offered some early warning signs 
True , 96 % of all incumbents were re-elected 
But a few days after the election , political analyst Alan Baron offered a revelation : For the first time since World War II the average re-election margin of House incumbents from both parties declined from the previous election 
Normally , when Republicans have a good year , Democratsaverage victory margin declines , and vice versa 
But in 1990 , voters declared a plague on both partieshouses , underscoring what polls and other focus groups demonstrate : The disaffection with politicians is not ideological 
Voters do not want more conservative or more liberal representation ; disgust many voters  want more responsive representation 
This helps explain the strong momentum for limiting lawmakersterms , a sentiment fueled by the recent disclosures of the House banking and restaurant fiascos 
Term limits would accomplish few of their proponentsgoals more-independentminded and less-beholden lawmakers and would result in many unintended consequences-far more power accruing to unelected staff and special-interest lobbyists 
But that is of little concern to frustrated voters who are lashing out because nothing else seems to work 
Plainly , Congress can best address this frustration by doing a better job on the issues bothering people-health care , taxes , jobs 
But there is little consensus among either politicians or the voters either politicians or the voters  on these issues 
So progress will be slow 
Congress can make some symbolic moves , however 
Congress  can eliminate Congress  more indefensible perquisites , such as the free prescription drugs 
More important , lawmakers ought to overhaul the disgraceful campaign-finance system to make congressional elections more competitive , and to reduce the role of money and influence peddlers in campaigns 
Granted , incumbents have little incentive to work against House incumbents from both parties  narrow self-interest 
But the threat of term limits or of electoral defeat focuses even the narrowly self-interested mind 
But there also have to be more fundamental changes in Congress's cozy arrangements 
The nexus of many of the problems entrenched arrogance , more concern for powerful interests than average citizens and the obscene preoccupation with campaign contributions is the committee system 
A powerful antidote would be to limit committee service , which would have few of the political and constitutional drawbacks of term limits 
The case is well articulated by two of the most experienced congressional observers : Richard Fenno , a University of Rochester political scientist and author of numerous books on Congress , and Charles Ferris , an attorney who served as chief counsel to both former Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield and former House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill 
While both men are deeply dismayed at the current state of Congress , both men  see term limits as a cure worse than the illness 
Term limits really hit at democracy , says Prof. Fenno 
Argues Mr. Ferris : Voters never should be prevented from electing a person who disgust many voters  think is the best representative of that community 
But disgust many voters  see a lot of virtue in limiting committee assignments 
This really would challenge these guys to shake up the system , says Mr. Fenno , noting that the power of interest groups is centered in committees 
Mr. Ferris believes this would put a vitality in the system while not resulting , unlike overall term limits , in a bunch of neophytes who would be more dependent on staff and lobbyists 
Mr. Ferris notes that the current system , in which a lawmaker gets a cherished committee assignment in a lawmaker  first or second term and then stays there for the rest of his tenure , breeds staleness 
Technology and economics and world dynamics are moving so quickly , but many of these members , while very bright , are locked into outdated beliefs and approaches , Charles Ferris  says 
If lawmakers had to change areas of expertise every three or four terms , less-beholden lawmakers  would not have the luxury of being intellectually lazy 
Currently , the Intelligence committees in both houses and the House Budget Committee limit members to six or eight years 
Why should not the Commerce committees and the tax-writing and appropriations panels be subjected to the same limits ? 
Any loss of legislative expertise would be more than offset by new ideas , new receptivity new thinking 
There would be one other incalculable benefit 
This would drive the lobbyists crazy
