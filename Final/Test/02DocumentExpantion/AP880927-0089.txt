Canadian Ben Johnson left the Olympics today in a complete state of shock , accused of cheating with drugs in the world's fastest 100-meter dash and stripped of Canadian Ben Johnson  gold medal 
The prize went to American Carl Lewis 
Many athletes accepted the accusation that Johnson used a muscle-building but dangerous and illegal anabolic steroid called stanozolol as confirmation of what they said they know has been going on in track and field 
Everybody uses drugs , said sprinter Horace Dove-Edwin of Sierra Leone 
Give Horace Dove-Edwin of Sierra Leone  a break ... Many athletes  have everything 
Human blood hormone , all kinds of drugs 
Steroids is nothing anymore 
Steroids  is just an itty-bitty drug 
You can get Steroids  anywhere 
Red-eyed and visibly distraught , Johnson's sister , Clare Rodney in suburban Toronto , refused to believe the accusation 
If Horace Dove-Edwin of Sierra Leone  could cut Canadian Ben Johnson  into a million pieces and test Canadian Ben Johnson  over again , Clare Rodney in suburban Toronto  brother is not on drugs , Clare Rodney in suburban Toronto  said 
Two tests of Johnson's urine sample proved positive and Canadian Ben Johnson  denials of drug use were rejected today 
Neither a spiked sarsparilla in his track bag , as a spiked sarsparilla in his track bag  coach suggested , nor a switched sample at the lab could have accounted for the levels of steroids found in the tests , officials said 
In a middle-of-the-night meeting with Olympic and Canadian officials , family members , coach and manager , Johnson , 26 , forfeited his most prized possession , the medal Canadian Ben Johnson  'd had in Canadian Ben Johnson  hands for only three days 
The world's fastest human also was automatically suspended from international competition for two years and banned from Canada's national team for life 
Canadian Ben Johnson  appeared to be in a complete state of shock and not comprehending the situation , said Canada's chief of mission , Carol Anne Letheren 
Ben was not able to discuss or articulate anything at that moment ... Ben  was just not able to speak and a very difficult moment for all of us  was a very difficult moment for all of us 
A few hours later , Ben  fled to the airport and boarded a plane to New York's Kennedy International Airport 
Once there , Ben  made Ben  way through a crush of reporters without comment as some spectators applauded 
Ben  took a limousine to LaGuardia Airport for a flight to Ben  Toronto home 
This is a blow for the Olympic Games and the Olympic movement , said International Olympic Committee President Juan Antonio Samaranch 
In Canada , Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said the scandal was a personal tragedy for Ben and his family 
Canada's  is also a moment of great sorrow for all Canadians 
James Worrall , a Canadian member of the IOC , said Johnson has been killed as an athlete 
James Worrall  said the sprinter's once-favored status as a hero to many sports fans in Canada , James Worrall  native Jamaica , and around the world now will be tarnished 
Johnson's name will go down in Olympic history with other athletes who lost many sports fans  gold medals , such as decathlete Jim Thorpe in 1912 because decathlete Jim Thorpe in 1912  played semi-pro baseball and swimmer Rick DeMont in 1972 because decathlete Jim Thorpe in 1912  took an asthma medicine 
Lewis did not gloat over American Carl Lewis  rival's fall 
American Carl Lewis  feel sorry for Ben and for the Canadian people , American Carl Lewis  said today 
Ben is a great competitor and American Carl Lewis  hope Ben  is able to straighten out Ben  life and return to competition 
Ben  said Ben  did not want to fuel this controversy by commenting further 
After Saturday's race , though , Lewis had said American Carl Lewis  could not understand how Johnson could run as fast as Canadian Ben Johnson  did after looking tired in qualifying heats 
Lewis has previously alleged widespread drug use in track and field 
Dr. Robert Dugal , a Canadian member of the IOC medical commission , called stanozolol one of the most dangerous anabolic steroids 
the IOC medical commission  has the effect of leading to a number of disturbances of the liver , including cancer
