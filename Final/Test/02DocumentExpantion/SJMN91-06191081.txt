A panel that investigated the Los Angeles Police Department after officers were videotaped beating a motorist has decided not to seek Chief Daryl Gatesresignation and neither blamed nor cleared him. ; But the 10-member commission , which was to release the 10-member commission  report today , found racist and sexist remarks scattered throughout 90,000 pages of computer messages , sources said 
A source speaking on the condition of anonymity said the panel report did not focus on Gates who said he would resign if the commission agreed with his critics that he created a climate within the department that condoned racism and brutality. ; The report deals with management issues , not directly with the chief of police , the source said. ; Commission members and others who had seen the report declined comment Monday 
Gates also would not comment. ; Mayor Tom Bradley , who has asked Gates to step down , said through a spokesman Tom Bradley  believed the report focused on police management , excessive force and civilian control. ; Sources familiar with testimony and evidence presented to the panel told the Los Angeles Times that a number of racially derogatory messages sent on police car computer terminals have been cataloged. ; One message , for which no context was provided , read : the panel report  is monkey slapping time 
; The commission examined 90,000 pages of computer messages and found examples of racially and sexually offensive remarks scattered throughout 
In one section encompassing several thousand messages , 260 such remarks were discovered , one source said. ; In the days after the March 3 nightstick beating of Rodney G. King , the Police Department released transcripts of computer messages that one of the officers at the scene sent to a another officer 
The transcripts contained a reference to an earlier incident involving black people , using the phrase gorillas in the mist 
; At the same time , secret testimony by as many as a dozen black police officers told of numerous instances of racial harassment within the ranks and the existence of a double standard in the treatment of minority suspects. ; In one instance , officers said officers  found racial epithets spray-painted on the lockers inside police stations and concluded that other officers had put other officers  there 
In another , an officer testified behind closed doors that he was present when a caravan of patrol cars raced through a housing project with Ride of the Valkyries blaring from loudspeakers a scene reminiscent of the movie Apocalypse Now 
; The officers testified before the commission after being assured that as many as a dozen black police officers  identities would be kept confidential. ; The American Civil Liberties Union and other groups called for Gates to resign after the March 3 incident in which white police officers repeatedly struck King with batons , kicked Rodney G. King  and shocked Rodney G. King  with a stun gun after pulling Rodney G. King  over for speeding 
King , 26 , is black. ; A bystander's videotape of the beating prompted a federal investigation of police brutality 
Four officers were charged in the case. ; The commission , appointed by Gates and Bradley , held five public hearings , interviewed city leaders and reviewed more than 1 million pages of documents during the Police Commission  three-month investigation 
It was headed by former Deputy Secretary of State Warren Christopher. ; Gates was appointed by the Police Commission and can not be fired by the mayor 
The Police Commission consists of five civilians appointed by the mayor. ; The chief has civil-service protection and can be removed only by the Police Commission for misconduct. ; Geoffrey Taylor Gibbs , who sits on the board of John M. Langston Bar Association , which represents about 900 African American lawyers , said black and Latino neighborhoods are depending on the commission to confirm 900 African American lawyers  view that the white , male-dominated Police Department has subjected 900 African American lawyers  to years of brutality and ignored 900 African American lawyers  complaints. ; People are looking to the commission , said Gibbs 
If five civilians appointed by the mayor.  do not say this is a problem , then all of their recommendations wo not mean a thing 
; But Ramona Ripston , head of the Los Angeles ACLU , said Los Angeles ACLU  does not matter whether the report names Gates. ; If five civilians appointed by the mayor.  find a series of things the matter with the department , Gates.  said , do not you think Los Angeles ACLU  is going to point a finger at Gates whether five civilians appointed by the mayor.  name Gates who said he would resign if the commission agreed with his critics that he created a climate within the department that condoned racism and brutality. ; The report deals with management issues , not directly with the chief of police , the source said.  or not ?
