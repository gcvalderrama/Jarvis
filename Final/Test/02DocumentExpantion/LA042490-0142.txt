Elizabeth Taylor is breathing with the assistance of a ventilator after undergoing surgery aimed at determining the cause of pneumonia that has kept her hospitalized for three weeks , her physicians said Monday 
The Academy Award-winning actress was admitted to St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica last week for treatment of the pneumonia , and was listed in serious condition in the hospital's intensive-care unit on Monday , her doctors said in a prepared statement 
The Academy Award-winning actress  is seriously ill and on Sunday underwent a lung biopsy to further determine the cause of The Academy Award-winning actress  pneumonia , the physiciansstatement said 
After surgery , The Academy Award-winning actress  breathing is now being assisted by a ventilator 
Her condition is presently stabilizing , and The Academy Award-winning actress  physicians are pleased with The Academy Award-winning actress  progress 
The statement provided no additional details of Taylor's condition , and hospital officials declined to comment beyond the statement 
Lisa del Favero , a New York City publicist for Taylor , said the actress is seriously ill , but a New York City publicist for Taylor  is not on a New York City publicist for Taylor  
hospital officials  are not talking about anything terminal 
Taylor's doctors expect to have results of the biopsy by Thursday , a New York City publicist for Taylor  said 
Del Favero said Taylor's four children Maria Burton-Carson , Liza Todd-Tivey and Christopher and Michael Wilding were with Maria Burton-Carson  at the hospital 
Taking a biopsy on the actress is called Sutton's law in medicine , after legendary holdup man Willie (the Actor )Sutton who said Sutton's  robbed banks because that is where the money is , said Dr. John G. Mohler , a pulmonary disease specialist at the USC School of Medicine 
If you do not know what the trouble is , you grab a biopsy and study the trouble  , because that is where the problem is , Mohler explained 
The problem is not easily found another way 
John G. Mohler  study the biopsy because that will dictate John G. Mohler  therapy 
If they (took a biopsy ), The Academy Award-winning actress  am sure she was not responding to antibiotics 
Mohler said Taylor's doctors are taking a prudent course by placing The Academy Award-winning actress  on a ventilator 
The Academy Award-winning actress  suffered a near-fatal bout of pneumonia in 1961 , and Mohler said a near-fatal bout of pneumonia  would seem that there is something basically wrong with The Academy Award-winning actress  lung structure or function 
When The Academy Award-winning actress  gets pneumonia , apparently a near-fatal bout of pneumonia  is more severe 
Emphasizing that John G. Mohler  has no personal familiarity with the actress's case , Mohler said John G. Mohler  does not blame The Academy Award-winning actress  doctors for being conservative 
Placing The Academy Award-winning actress  on a ventilator would be a prudent and conservative thing to do , even if The Academy Award-winning actress  did not have any difficulty 
a precautionary step in this case  may just be a precautionary step in this case 
Taylor , 58 , entered Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital in Marina del Rey on April 10 suffering what The Academy Award-winning actress  publicist then described as a severe sinus infection 
a New York City publicist for Taylor  was transferred to St. John's April 16 when a New York City publicist for Taylor  condition worsened 
Dr. Patricia Murray , an infectious disease specialist , said in a statement last week that Taylor had pneumonia and was being treated intravenously with antibiotics and will remain hospitalized (indefinitely )
Taylor has been plagued with health problems for years , particularly recurring back troubles that began with a fall from a horse during filming of the 1945 movie National Velvet 
In 1983 , Patricia Murray  acknowledged a 35-year addiction to sleeping pills and painkillers prescribed for a wide range of health problems 
Taylor has been treated for alcohol and drug abuse problems at the Betty Ford Clinic
