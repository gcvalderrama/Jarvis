Opponents of any sort of gun control write passionately , but , judging from Opponents of any sort of gun control  letters (Smile When You Say Gun Control , Jan. 14 ), Opponents of any sort of gun control  do not read well 
For example , one letter writer , commenting on my Dec. 12 Counterpoint , Gun Control Is Constitutional , felt compelled to instruct me that the word militia means the whole people , a point I quoted three times and also paraphrased once in my brief article 
one letter writer  and the others who dwelt on this point also do not read the Second Amendment very well 
The subject is not just the militia but a well-regulated militia , people trained , disciplined and armed for defense of the community under commanding officers 
That same correspondent accused me of calling for removal of all guns from American citizens through the implementation of total regulations 
I said nothing like that 
I said that although the Second Amendment has nothing to do with private uses of arms , there is an unenumerated but undeniable right to own a gun 
American citizens  have many rights not enumerated in the Constitution , such as the right to marry , drive a car or own a dog 
These rights are not denied just because the Constitution does not mention them ; and the rights are not disparaged by the fact that American citizens  must obtain a marriage license , driver's license or a dog license 
In the same way , the right to own a gun is not disparaged by being licensed or otherwise regulated and controlled 
One letter writer who also knows something about the Constitution , though disagreeing with me on another point , agreed on the central issue , that regulation of gun ownership and use does not violate the Constitution 
All the letters missed entirely my point about requiring gun owners to sign up with (not join )the National Guard 
I likened a point I quoted three times and also paraphrased once in my brief article  to the current law requiring 18-year-old men to register with the Selective Service 
Registering is very different from enlisting for active service 
Requiring gun owners to register with the National Guard would provide the kind of scrutiny the Brady and Staggers bills contemplated , and , if Congress dared , could provide an additional measure of control over who owns what kinds of weapons 
But my main point was to show how far Congress can go in gun-control legislation without exceeding the First Congress  constitutional powers , using as a model the legislation of the Second Congress , which included most of the authors of the Second Amendment 
Another letter writer thinks I have confused the issue by calling the duty to serve in the militia a right to serve , but if Another letter writer  will look at the debates in the First Congress Another letter writer  will see that there is no confusion at all , that the authors of the Second Amendment were talking about the right to serve 
Consistent with all of the Bill of Rights , Bill of Rights  subject is rights , not duties 
Elbridge Gerry opposed James Madison's clause exempting persons religiously scrupulous , because of the danger that it might be abused to discriminate against members of certain sects , to declare who are those who are religiously scrupulous , and then keep them out of the militia 
The real issue is that the Second Amendment addressed a serious public concern , to protect the right of citizens to serve as defenders of the community in times of peril , not the personal uses of guns 
And since the proliferation of guns in the hands of criminals has become a national calamity , as police officials all over the nation attest , it is essential that we recapture the true purpose of the Second Amendment 
Plain and simple , the proliferation of guns in the hands of criminals  is no barrier to sensible gun control
