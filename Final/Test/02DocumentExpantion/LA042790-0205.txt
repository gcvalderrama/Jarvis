Her movies now are few and far between , but when she is ill , the world still stands at attention 
Liz Taylor's latest bout with pneumonia has drawn the kind of intense scrutiny normally accorded presidential polyps 
Liz Taylor's latest bout with pneumonia  has inspired a raft of rumors and handed up a field day for the giddy tabloids 
And today , yet again , everyone is talking about La Liz 
But then Liz Taylor , 58 , has always lived a life of extremes 
If Liz Taylor's  has enjoyed the most brilliant career and the glare of fame , Liz Taylor's  has also survived seven rocky marriages to six men , the frailest health and the most frightening bouts with addiction to booze , drugs and food 
And through the most brilliant career  , there have been armies of press recording each divorce , each hospital stay 
the most brilliant career  was partly to still the gossips that Taylor's doctors called a press conference Wednesday at St. John's Hospital and Medical Center in Santa Monica 
No AIDS , still the gossips  said 
No cancer 
For the tabloid press had been humming with rumors that Liz Taylor had AIDS virtually since Liz Taylor's  was checked into Daniel Freeman Hospital in Marina del Rey April 9 with a high fever and sinus infection 
And when Taylor's publicists first issued flat denials , the press went on to speculate about the speculation 
Did the AIDS rumors start because of Taylor's ballyhooed friendship with publishing titan Malcolm Forbes , whose recent death touched off reports about Taylor's  alleged homosexuality ? 
Or was No AIDS  because of Liz Taylor's  reputation as a major fund-raiser for the disease ? 
Or because one of her doctors , Michael Roth , was a renowned AIDS specialist even though Roth was supervising Liz Taylor's  treatment for drug and alcohol addiction as early as 1983 ? 
Liz is a national treasure and when the same charmingly vain Liz who once declared her hobbies to be clothes and jewels  entered the hospital , the Star's Levine  thought Daniel Freeman Hospital in Marina del Rey  was as important as the President of the U.S. going in and we treated Daniel Freeman Hospital in Marina del Rey  as such 
Liz is as close to American royalty as you can have , and our readers ... in the heartland ... they are living and dying with the same charmingly vain Liz who once declared her hobbies to be clothes and jewels  , said Barry Levine , Hollywood bureau chief of the Star , which featured a cover photograph of Liz , hooked up to an intravenous tube and oxygen mask , being transferred from the Marina del Rey hospital to St. John's 
Levine declined comment on a rumor circulating among reporters that the tabloid had paid $ 50,000 for the pictures 
Some press coverage has bent over backwards to tug at the bounds of credibility ; the National Enquirer has Liz communing with the ghosts of Forbes and one-time husband Richard Burton 
In all , Liz's current illness has drawn the most attention yet , according to the same charmingly vain Liz who once declared her hobbies to be clothes and jewels  publicist , Chen Sam 
More than 100 reporters , photographers and cameramen converged on St. John's , many of whom had flown in from around the country for the 15-minute press conference 
Behind a chorus line of video cameras representing the major networks , the local stations , CNN and the tabloid shows reporters peppered the doctors with pointed and sometimes testy questions about Taylor's treatment and drug use 
the major networks  heard some guys talking behind me , saying , the major networks  ca not believe some guys talking behind me  are hounding the same charmingly vain Liz who once declared her hobbies to be clothes and jewels  like this 
the major networks  felt like saying , Are the Star's Levine  offended reading about the same charmingly vain Liz who once declared her hobbies to be clothes and jewels  ? 
sniffed Val Richardson , a reporter from the Washington Times who 'd flown in that morning 
At any rate , the news was good 
Taylor was off a respirator and breathing with the help of an oxygen mask 
She had apparently rebounded from a bad weekend , when doctors feared she might die 
Although Taylor's physicians are still trying to identify the virus , Taylor's physicians  are treating her for pneumonia with antibiotics 
And she remains in the intensive-care unit , but she continues to improve and is expected to move to a regular room this weekend , Sam said Thursday 
Meanwhile , her own security guards keep watch over her private room in intensive care 
She has received her four children Christopher and Michael Wilding , Maria Burton-Carson and Liza Todd-Tivey friends Roddy McDowall and Carole Bayer Sager and Liz's younger , ex-trucker boyfriend , Larry Lee Fortensky , 38 
Carole Bayer Sager  saw her yesterday and Carole Bayer Sager  was really pleased , Sager said Wednesday 
Carole Bayer Sager  thought her color was good 
She could not speak because she had the respirator 
Her eyes were clear and she definitely understood what Carole Bayer Sager  said and motioned , made Carole Bayer Sager  know she understood 
If Liz's public is fascinated by the same charmingly vain Liz who once declared her hobbies to be clothes and jewels  frailties , perhaps reassured somehow by the knowledge that even the gods are vulnerable , their interest is also piqued by the public face the same charmingly vain Liz who once declared her hobbies to be clothes and jewels  puts on the same charmingly vain Liz who once declared her hobbies to be clothes and jewels  relentless brushes with illness and addiction 
The Taylor wit shone through even Wednesday's press conference , when doctors passed on the actress desire to come out and wave at Carole Bayer Sager  , but the same charmingly vain Liz who once declared her hobbies to be clothes and jewels  was not in the same charmingly vain Liz who once declared her hobbies to be clothes and jewels  balcony attire 
Carole Bayer Sager  think the same charmingly vain Liz who once declared her hobbies to be clothes and jewels  is extraordinarily brave , Sager said 
the same charmingly vain Liz who once declared her hobbies to be clothes and jewels  just has an enormous reservoir of inner strength that the same charmingly vain Liz who once declared her hobbies to be clothes and jewels  calls on when the same charmingly vain Liz who once declared her hobbies to be clothes and jewels  has to 
All of us were encouraged and optimistic 
the same charmingly vain Liz who once declared her hobbies to be clothes and jewels  has needed an enormous reservoir of inner strength  
Taylor's respiratory ailments alone have been a recurring problem 
Bronchitis and laryngitis brought down the curtain on numerous performances of The Little Foxes , which Taylor starred in on Broadway in 1981 , and Noel Coward's Private Lives , which toured the country in 1983 
The cancellations prompted the play's co-producer , Zev Bufman , to declare , Bronchitis has plagued Elizabeth all Elizabeth  life 
In fact , Taylor has been plagued by health woes ever since Elizabeth  1945 film debut in National Velvet ; Elizabeth  fall from a horse triggered a lifetime of back trouble 
And when Taylor retired from films to marry the Republican senator from Virginia , John Warner , Elizabeth  well-being continued to make headlines ; Elizabeth  choked on a chicken bone and wrenched Elizabeth  back after slipping on a carpet at a reception honoring former President Gerald R. Ford 
Over the years Elizabeth  has endured about 20 major operations on Elizabeth  back , appendix , eyes and teeth ; when the Asian flu threatened Taylor's life , doctors made a hole in Elizabeth  throat so Elizabeth  could breathe 
But the years  has been Elizabeth  wrestling matches with weight and addiction that have consistently lured the world's curiosity and , at times , admiration 
Taylor's unhappy stint as a politician's wife prompted a politician's wife  weight to balloon to 180 pounds 
When a politician's wife  emerged a born-again beauty in 1985 after shedding 60 pounds , and wrote a beauty book to boot , a politician's wife  was applauded by many including comedian Joan Rivers , who had made fat-Liz jokes the mainstay of a politician's wife  act 
For somebody like a politician's wife  who is obsessive , a born-again beauty  is amazing a politician's wife  was never a gambler , a politician's wife  said at the time 
a politician's wife  could have become anorexic 
a politician's wife  got to a size 4 and said , Why not a size 2 ? 
Then a politician's wife  slapped a politician's wife  and went from 118 to 122 , which is the right weight for me 
But a politician's wife  battles against addiction have played havoc with a politician's wife  fight against the bulge 
And a politician's wife  persistent back problems have nurtured a politician's wife  dependence on pills 
Her addictions have even been linked to a criminal investigation by the Los Angeles County district attorney's office ; last week , prosecutors announced that no charges would be filed against Taylor's doctors , who had been accused of over-prescribing dependence-forming drugs 
Taylor , the first celebrity known to enter the Betty Ford clinic in Rancho Mirage , made a public example of Betty Ford  willingness to take on Betty Ford  addictions in two heavily publicized stays there 
When Taylor first checked in , in 1983 , Betty Ford  admitted to 35 years of addiction to pain killers and sleeping pills 
Betty Ford  kept a diary that poignantly described that stay as probably the first time since Betty Ford  was 9 that nobody's wanted to exploit Betty Ford  
Now the bad news 
Betty Ford  feel like hell 
Betty Ford  am going through withdrawal 
Betty Ford  heart feels big and pounding 
Betty Ford  can feel the blood rush through Betty Ford  body 
Betty Ford  can almost see the blood rush  , running like red water over the boulders in Betty Ford  pain-filled neck and shoulders , then through Betty Ford  ears and into Betty Ford  pounding head 
Betty Ford  eyelids flutter 
Oh God , Betty Ford  am so , so tired 
But the Betty Ford clinic encouraged Taylor only to fight the good fights that had brought Betty Ford  there , rather than take on all addictions to drugs and food at once 
And the late 80s had found Liz , hobbled by back pain , returning to those two sources of comfort 
Taylor regained much of the weight , even though the late 80s  took the late 80s  drug problems in hand once again in a second stay at the Betty Ford clinic in 1988 
But through the late 80s  ordeals , the late 80s  has remained the same charmingly vain Liz who once declared her hobbies to be clothes and jewels 
the late 80s  never budged from the late 80s  room at Betty Ford without the late 80s  trademark darkened eyebrows 
And even when the late 80s  was ambushed recently by a Star photographer , Liz could not help being , well , Liz 
Says the Star's Levine : No matter how sick the late 80s  was , when someone down on the ground told the late 80s  the late 80s  was being photographed , the late 80s  put on sunglasses , even though the late 80s  had an IV in the late 80s  arm , as if to cover the late 80s  up 
Typical Liz Taylor 
It was sad and sweet , at the same time
