THE FIGHT over the North American Free Trade Agreement yesterday shifted outside Washington to the Congressional districts of members , sampling public opinion at home during this VeteransDay holiday weekend 
The pro-Nafta forces , exulting over the debate victory of Vice President Al Gore over Texan billionaire Ross Perot , hoped members  had finally captured the elusive momentum necessary to carry members  to victory in the House vote next Wednesday 
A USA Today/CNN poll of debate watchers found support for the trade pact between the US , Canada and Mexico had shot up from 34 per cent before the debate to 57 per cent after A USA Today/CNN poll of debate watchers  
Arthur Andersen & Company yesterday released a survey , by yesterday  tax and business advisory service , which found that large majorities of executives of medium-sized companies in Canada , Mexico and the US strongly support Nafta 
Meanwhile in Mexico the country's Congress launched a fierce attack on Mr Perot and other critics of Mexico  political system yesterday , in a furious response to Mr Perot's comments in the debate 
Mr Perot claimed Mexicans were treated worse than animals and livestock in the US , were oppressed by the government , and enjoyed few if any labour and democratic rights 
Ross Perot  said just 34 families owned half the country , and some 85m others lived in poverty 
The Mexican Congress issued a statement , supported by most political parties , which said : We can not ignore however , that certain judgments expressed , apart from showing a serious ignorance for our country , attack and offend Mexicans 
We condemn most political parties  as inadmissible and without foundation 
US opponents of Nafta believe that fear of job and investment losses to Mexico will outweigh any new-found enthusiasm for the pact 
The only thing that matters is the economy , said Mr Christopher Whalen , a Washington trade consultant 
The political equation still is going to be that congressmen who vote for Nafta will have to look for other employment next year 
Trying to blunt any momentum for the administration , Congressman David Bonior , an anti-Nafta whip , on Wednesday announced that David Bonior  had 219 of 434 members pledged to vote against the pact 
However , David Bonior  needs at least 10-12 votes more than the majority to prevent last-minute switches , as the Administration increases the administration  pressure 
The Administration this week has picked up 10 public endorsement votes , and claims to have a total of 192 
the administration  is publishing a free 800 telephone number with the offer to voters to send , free of charge , pro-Nafta telegrams to voters  congressman 
Around the country , the opposition troops are planning rallies , marches , town hall meetings and accountability meetingswith congressmen 
Ms Lori Wallach , an anti-Nafta leader , said Nafta would be won or lost in the congressmen's home districts 
Washington will not be bereft of activity over the long weekend 
The anti-Nafta CitizensTrade Campaign is bringing Nafta Clausto the Capitol to distribute gifts in a parody of the president's effort to sell Nafta to a reluctant Congress
