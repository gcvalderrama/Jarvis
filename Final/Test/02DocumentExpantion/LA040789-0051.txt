Backed by public antipathy toward the Exxon Valdez oil spill disaster , Gov. Steve Cowper on Thursday threatened to close down the trans-Alaska oil pipeline unless Backed by public antipathy toward the Exxon Valdez oil spill disaster , Gov. Steve Cowper on Thursday  owners meet Gov. Steve Cowper on Thursday  terms for improved safety and cleanup measures 
At the same time , it was disclosed that federal officials are probing the possibility that Exxon's 987-foot oil tanker was on autopilot shortly before Exxon's 987-foot oil tanker  ran aground and that the electronic navigation aid confused the crew and contributed to the accident 
After meeting personally with top executives from three of the seven oil companies that own the Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. earlier in the week , Cowper asked top executives from three of the seven oil companies that own the Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. earlier in the week  to respond by noon Thursday to his six-point safety plan 
As the deadline approached , the three companies ARCO Alaska , BP America and Exxon USA responded with a six-page list of ideas 
An aide to the governor described the companiesresponse as generally OK but said that Cowper may issue an order putting Gov. Steve Cowper on Thursday  plan into effect anyway 
In one proposed draft of an order , continuation of routine operations at the Alyeska Marine Terminal near the town of Valdez is described as creating a substantial potential risk of additional oil spill because the consortium has failed to demonstrate the consortium  can manage a large spill with minimal environmental effects 
To reduce the risk , the order , which could be issued as soon as today , would require : A written description , due within 72 hours of the order's being signed , of the location of all oil-spill gear at the consortium's disposal 
Equipment must be dedicated to oil-spill cleanup only 
The names of 12 oil spill-response team members who do nothing but respond to oil spills and who are available for such duty 24 hours a day 
Installation of Booms The installation of containment booms around all oil tankers in the harbor 
Permanent restriction of tanker traffic to daylight hours 
A limit of one tanker being loaded at a time until all designated cleanup equipment is in place , and the end of all loading within 72 hours if cleanup equipment is not ready 
Demonstration by April 30 of adequate gear and supplies to handle another 10-million-gallon spill 
Failure to comply with the emergency order would carry penalties that range from fines to criminal prosecution and jailing of company officials 
company officials  want the oil industry to be ready for a spill of this magnitude if the oil industry  happens tomorrow , Cowper said 
There is going to have to be a plan that satisfies us , company officials  people , and a plan that satisfies us  will be tough 
If a plan that satisfies us  is not complied with , company officials  do not have any remedy available to company officials  except shut down the terminal 
And company officials  will do a plan that satisfies us  
State law gives the governor the authority to close the terminal if State law  does not meet state oil-cleanup plan requirements 
Such a move would swiftly halt oil production in the state , and worsen supply problems in the lower 48 states 
Such a move  also would badly pinch the state treasury , which relies on oil taxes and royalties for 85 % of Such a move  income 
Cowper said Gov. Steve Cowper on Thursday  would seek special legislation to tap Alaska's $ 10-billion Permanent Fund , a kind of super budget reserve , should any terminal shutdown last long enough to cause short-term funding woes for the state 
Even if Cowper's shutdown were found to illegally interfere with interstate commerce and be overturned in court , Cowper's shutdown  could last long enough to drive home a point about improving cleanup response plans 
The Alyeska companiesoffer included the immediate start of random drug and alcohol testing on board ships and the continued use of two-tugboat escorts beyond Bligh Reef , the shallows into which the Exxon Valdez crashed March 24 before leaking 240,000 barrels of oil into ecologically sensitive Prince William Sound 
Alyeska also suggested expanding the Coast Guard's radar system , which had been scaled down as a cost-saving measure in the early 1980s , and offered to keep on hand additional equipment to contain , skim and disperse spills 
Meanwhile , the chairman of Exxon Corp. told Congress Thursday that the third mate who was on the bridge of the Exxon Valdez when it ran aground has told company lawyers that the third mate who was on the bridge of the Exxon Valdez when it ran aground  turned off the ship's automatic pilot in an effort to avoid the reef 
Exxon Chairman Lawrence G. Rawl  understanding is that the chairman of Exxon Corp.  turned that computer off and it was not as if that computer  hit the rocks on automatic pilot , Exxon Chairman Lawrence G. Rawl said in testimony before the Senate Commerce Committee 
Coast Guard spokesman Bruce Pimental in Valdez said investigators still are trying to determine if the autopilot actually was used the night of the accident and if the autopilot  was , when the autopilot  was turned off 
Tom Kilpatrick of the California Maritime Academy , a former captain a former captain  , said autopilots take full control of a ship once autopilots  are switched on 
The helm will not respond if the first clue  is in autopilot , Tom Kilpatrick of the California Maritime Academy  said 
That should be the first clue to people on the bridge that the autopilot is on 
A Coast Guard official in Anchorage said the third mate in charge of the tanker shortly before Anchorage  went aground did complain of being unable to get the vessel to respond to the helm 
The nation's worst oil spill penetrated a national park Thursday , with an airborne spotter seeing an oil sheen up on some of the rocks and seeing staining on the rocks at Kenai Fjords National Park , park spokesman John Quinley said 
However , favorable winds were still keeping most of the crude offshore , he said 
Also on Thursday , the former captain of the Exxon Valdez , Joseph Hazelwood , left jail in New York after a judge slashed a judge  bail from $ 500,000 to $ 25,000 
Justice Thomas Starke said the earlier bail amount was unconstitutionally excessive 
Hazelwood , who lives with Joseph Hazelwood  wife and daughter in the Long Island community of Huntington , was ordered to return to court May 5 for extradition proceedings to Alaska , where Joseph Hazelwood  is wanted on three misdemeanor charges in the spill 
The judge who had imposed the earlier bail is an environmentalist and former commercial fisherman 
The judge who had imposed the earlier bail  called the spill the worst man-made disaster since Hiroshima
