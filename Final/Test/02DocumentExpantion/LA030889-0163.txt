Canadian Coach Charlie Francis , who claimed that sprinter Ben Johnson's urine sample at the Seoul Olympics was spiked with a banned steroid , told an acquaintance in Seoul that Johnson had worried that sprinter Ben Johnson's  might test positive 
Lynda Huey , who was at Seoul working for NBC-TV and as a physical therapist for some American athletes , said Tuesday that Francis had bragged to Lynda Huey  about Johnson's preparations for a showdown against U.S. sprinter Carl Lewis 
Huey said Lynda Huey  had known Francis since 1980 when he and sprinter Angella Taylor Issajenko stayed at Lynda Huey  home in Los Angeles 
Huey said Lynda Huey  had seen Francis on a practice track at Seoul and Francis on a practice track  had greeted Lynda Huey  as an old friend 
Charlie came over to Lynda Huey  and we started talking , Huey said 
We were talking about how Ben might do 
Charlie said , Ben's more afraid of failing the drug test than he is of Carl Lewis 
Charlie Francis  was bragging 
Huey said Lynda Huey  is tired of hearing Francis , who has been in Toronto testifying at a Canadian inquiry into drug use in sport , say that Johnson was clean at the Olympics 
Francis testified that Johnson was not taking the steroid , stanozolol , before the Games and that a mysterious person might have slipped something into Johnson's beverage in the drug-testing area before the sprinter gave the sprinter  urine specimen 
Clean or not , Huey said , Francis must have had some reason to think Ben may not pass the test
