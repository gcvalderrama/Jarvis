The organisers said The organisers  were sending a message to Virginia's three wavering congressmen that a yes vote on Nafta in the House on Wednesday would be remembered in November
That is , next November's mid-term elections , when those assembled - mostly followers of Texas billionaires of Mr Ross Perot and union members - would unite to throw the rascals out of office 
We are absolutely for free trade , says Mr Bill Diggitt , the state director of Mr Perot's United We Stand

Mr Josh Greenwood , owner of a small hydroelectric company , says : I might run against my congressman myself 
Mexican workers are treated like slaves , Josh Greenwood  claims 
In Virginia there was slavery , but the slaves were expensive and the people who owned the slaves  valued the slaves

Mr Ralph Dombrower , a Perot devotee , brought the results of an interactive computer poll showing a growing isolationism among American voters
