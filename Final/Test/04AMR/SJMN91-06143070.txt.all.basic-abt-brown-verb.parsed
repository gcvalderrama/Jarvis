# ::snt Gandhi, whose Congress Party provided the main backing to the New Delhi government at the time, was widely seen as being behind the dismissal, which angered the Tamil Tigers and dozens of political enemies in Sri Lanka and southern India supporters in southern India. ; During the current election, the Congress Party faced a brisk challenge from a leftist coalition led by former Prime Minister V.P. Singh, who denounced what J.B. Patnaik called Congress's " culture of corruption " and advocated divisive job set-asides for India's lower castes and religious minorities. ; An even tougher test for the Congress -- and the centrist ideology that has held India together for four decades -- has been mounted by Hindu ultranationalists from the Bharatiya Janata Party, who denounced Gandhi for allegedly pandering to India's Muslim minority and directing too many government resources to religious and caste minorities in an effort to win votes. ; Election in India : turmoil and tragedy ; The Congress Party, which has dominated Indian politics since independence in 1947, is being challenged by a center-left coalition that wants to break down the caste system and a right-wing party that seeks a more openly Hindu, less secular India. ; ... ; Caste system ; Hierarchical ranking of social groups rooted in Hindu religious beliefs that people are born with different intellectual and spiritual qualities and capabilities
