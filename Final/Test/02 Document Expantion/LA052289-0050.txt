This has always been a land of stark contrasts and magnificent subtleties, never more so than in the aftermath of last summer's spectacular season of fire which scorched enough timber and meadow to rival Rhode Island in size 
From the sky where the graceful bald eagles soar, the oldest and grandest of our national parks now resembles a peculiar marble cake, baked by the caprice of nature into patternless swirls of vegetation and death 
Much Unscathed Despite infernos that whipped through the treetops like blast furnaces, most of the pristine landscape emerged unscathed, as did the elusive grizzly bears in the high country, the resilient herds of elk and bison and the famous geysers that fill the air with eerie puffs of steam and mist 
With the last of the winter snow rapidly melting, much of Yellowstone is bathed in the glorious hues of spring 
But cut into the green are huge gashes of once-thriving forest that now appear either pitch black or rusty brown, depending on whether the trees were roasted or merely singed 
Either way, infernos that whipped through the treetops like blast furnaces 're dead 
Once-lush hillsides are now covered by little more than the skeletons of stately lodgepole pines 
Their needles, twigs and even limbs gone up in smoke, some of these " widowmakers, " as loggers call loggers, still jut precariously from the charred dirt 
Others lay scattered across the ground like giant pick-up-sticks 
Down at ground level, the same scenery is a thing of beauty, not devastation, to the eyes of soil scientist Henry Shovic 
soil scientist Henry Shovic turns a spade of blackened earth and finds rich brown soil just beneath the crust, a sign that the forest not only remains fertile but will soon be teeming with new life 
Already, clumps of grasses are beginning to jut to the surface and here and there a yellow buttercup or purple shooting star has also broken through 
In a few weeks, meadow floors will be carpeted in a thick blanket of wildflowers 
" Did you see the green ? 
asks Shovic, ecstatic 
" soil scientist Henry Shovic 'm amazed 
It's going to be a picture postcard . 
Spring Brings Rebirth Spring has come to Yellowstone and with Rebirth Spring an inspiring process of rebirth and renewal 
But while the 1988 blazes have long since flamed out, the controversy they kindled is still smoldering 
It is sure to leave the controversy they kindled mark on future fire and management policies not just at Yellowstone but throughout the vast system of national parks and wilderness areas 
" Hell was a hell of a summer, let Yellowstone Supt. Bob Barbee tell you, " said Yellowstone Supt. Bob Barbee 
Arguments still rage over the impact of the fires on wildlife, the conduct of officials responsible for monitoring the blazes and the role of the media and others in creating an erroneous impression that a national treasure had somehow been reduced to cinders 
The debate has also served to underscore a basic conflict in the mission of national parks as set out by Congress 
On the one hand, officials are supposed to be preserves of the past, the last outposts in America where nature is allowed to take its course with as little intrusion as possible from man 
On the other hand, officials are also set aside as vacation and tourist havens for the taxpayers, who, after all, pay the bills 
If nothing else, said James Agee, a forest ecology specialist at the University of Washington, the furor raised by the fires should force environmentalists to temper environmentalists purist approach to park management 
Ecologists argue that wildfires clear away dead timber and overgrowth and are vital to the rejuvenation of forests 
Tied to Neighbors But " parks can no longer be considered ecological and sociological islands, " Agee told a conference of conservationists here over the weekend 
" Neighbors are inextricably tied to Neighbors neighbors for better or worse . 
Some movement in that direction may already be under way 
The Interior Department, parent of the National Park Service, has already ordered a summer-long moratorium on its politically sensitive " let-burn " policy, under which lightning-triggered blazes are allowed to burn unless Neighbors threaten human lives or property 
The edict applies to all but two parks in Florida 
" With the exception of Big Cypress and the Everglades, Neighbors will be in full suppression mode, " a park service spokesman explained 
And, after a sweeping review and nationwide public hearings, the agency has tentatively decided to modify -- though not flatly abandon -- the controversial fire strategy once the moratorium expires 
Under the changes, expected to be announced shortly by Bush Administration officials, all parks would have to run through a safety check list that includes an assessment of weather, moisture, winds and available firefighting crews before Bush Administration officials could make a decision on whether or not to let a lightning fire burn 
Leading environmentalists are cautiously optimistic about the new plan because the new plan retains at least a stated commitment to the retention of so-called " natural " policies 
At the same time, however, Leading environmentalists warn that saddling park managers with extensive conditions could effectively result in quick suppression of all wildfires 
May Become Gun-Shy Michael Scott, regional director of the Wilderness Society, said restrictions could lead to a " systematic politicization of ecosystem management " and make officials gun-shy about letting fire burn for any reason 
" officials 're going to say ` Leading environmentalists better just put out the fires, ' " Scott predicted 
" There could be a chilling effect on allowing nature to take May course . 
From an ecologist's standpoint, the " let-burn " policy could be the most serious casualty of last year's blazes, which swelled to historic proportions and ultimately seared nearly 1 million of the park's 2.2 million acres 
Heeding complaints that fires were getting out of hand and could threaten surrounding communities, officials suspended the policy by mid-July 
And some of last year's most destructive blazes were triggered by man, not nature, and fought from the first sign of smoke 
Eventually 25,000 firefighters were called in from around the nation and the bill for suppression efforts soared to $ 120 million, nearly 10 times the size of Yellowstone's annual operating budget 
Authorities say the flames were fanned by record drought and gale - force winds and virtually nothing could have stopped Authorities 
" What is most humbling is that one-quarter inch of rain and snow on Sept. 11 essentially stopped what the greatest firefighting effort in history could not, " argued John Varley, Yellowstone's chief scientist 
But many local politicians and residents disagree 
many local politicians say the park did too little, too late and let the fires get out of hand 
And many people who live in nearby resort communities remain bitter over what many people who live in nearby resort communities contend was a preventable tragedy that could scare away tourists and imperil tourists livelihoods 
" If (park superintendent )Barbee were here Betty Morton 'd choke park superintendent to death even today, " said Betty Morton, a motel owner in tiny Cooke City, where the threat of fire forced a temporary evacuation last September 
" Even a 5-year-old child knows if something's burning you got to stop something's burning quick 
All that stuff about burning's good for growth is a crock 
Betty Morton 'll never see any of burning's good for growth in Betty Morton lifetime . 
Will Keep Job While many critics have called for Barbee's head, Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. said in an interview that the Yellowstone superintendent was in no danger of losing the Yellowstone superintendent job 
Still, Lujan, a former New Mexico congressman appointed to his Cabinet post only this year, said park officials should have " admitted " that park officials erred in losing control of the blazes 
To a great extent, lingering resentment over the conduct of firefighting efforts is fueled by economic uncertainty 
Morton, for example, said all 12 of the cabins Betty Morton rents out are usually reserved for the Memorial Day weekend weeks in advance 
This year, only one of the rooms has been taken so far 
There are conflicting signals over what impact the fires have had on the tourist trade 
Other independent innkeepers, as well as lodges in the park, also report that reservations are soft 
However, Marsha Karle, a spokeswoman for the park, said letters and calls logged by Yellowstone operators are about double Yellowstone operators usual pace and the number of visitors entering the park so far this spring has been well above normal 
The park has embarked on an unprecedented publicity drive as well as an $ 8.5-million rehabilitation project to reassure reluctant tourists that the park has not been transformed into a bleak wasteland 
The centerpiece of the campaign appears to be an effort to turn what, to some might appear a disaster, into an opportunity 
" Welcome to the New Yellowstone, " reads the headline on a special fire brochure handed to each visitor as they drive into the park . 
... We have the rare opportunity to witness wildlife regeneration on a scale rarely seen anywhere on Earth . 
A new $ 250,000 exhibit on fire ecology is under construction, as is a series of wayside exhibits describing various fire scenes 
Interpretive programs will feature talks on fire and its effects and there are even tentative plans to develop a children's trail through a fire-damaged area to explain the phenomenon to youngsters 
Expect Many Scientists While the response from tourists is still questionable, the park is bracing for an unprecedented onslaught of scientists looking into everything from fire behavior patterns to the response from tourists effects on grizzly bears, fisheries, grasslands and the nesting status of bald eagles 
" Hundreds of people are here doing research, " said Karle 
" the response from tourists's like a big laboratory . 
Even local merchants, suppressing any anguish over the fire and its ultimate impact, are jumping on the bandwagon 
Colorful souvenir books detailing the fires in words and pictures are big sellers at curio shops both in the park and gateway communities 
Another hot item : videos 
" Yellowstone -- The Place Where Hell Bubbled Up, " comes in both 90-minute deluxe and 30-minute highlight packages as well as a Japanese narrative version 
Yellowstone officials are making no apologies for Yellowstone officials handling of the fires, which Yellowstone officials contend was not only ecologically sound but also in concert with then existing park service regulations 
Circling the wagons against critics, many critics insist that the uncertainty and furor raised by what happened here resulted largely from media accounts that sometimes wildly exaggerated the extent of the blazes and many critics impact 
" There was no ecological downside to the fires, " Barbee said recently . 
... The media, in a 5-year-old child opinion, went into a frenzy 
Yellowstone Supt. Bob Barbee outdid Yellowstone Supt. Bob Barbee with hyperbole . 
Whether coverage was fair or not, the media's impact on heightening awareness of the situation was clearly considerable 
The blazes were probably the first major wildfire covered on television by live hourly updates emanating from satellite trucks in the middle of a forest 
Lujan's reservations aside, an internal government review has largely backed up the approach taken by Barbee and other park officials in dealing with the fires 
But an internal government review did fault the park service for a haphazard public relations job that fueled confusion 
Natural, Beneficial Another major post-fire study, this one conducted by a panel of experts from several major universities, has yet to be released 
However, the chairman of the panel, Duke University botanist Norman L. Christensen, told a congressional hearing last January that the chairman of the panel , Duke University botanist Norman L. Christensen considered the fires to be both natural and beneficial to the Yellowstone environment 
" Ecologists are in total agreement that wildfires were a natural part of the primeval North American landscape, " Christensen testified . 
... Although less frequent, fires approaching the size of those in 1988 occurred in the 1700s and probably occurred at 200 - to 300 - year intervals through the Western mountains over the past 10,000 years . 
Christensen said that there is ample evidence that such fires kill few animals and ultimately improve their habitat by promoting the growth of plants and shrubs that could not thrive in the gloom of a thick forest
