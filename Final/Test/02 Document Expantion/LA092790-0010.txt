Proposals to limit the terms of members of Congress and of state legislators are popular and getting more so, according to the pundits and the polls 
Students of government like me find government like me hard to understand why 
Contrary to most of the propaganda on the subject, these constitutional changes wo n't do what their proponents say their proponents want to accomplish 
For example, term limitations will not decrease the influence of interest groups and interest groups money on elections 
Quite the contrary 
Forcing senior members of a legislature to retire means that the new candidates who try to take their place will have to invest heavily in achieving the name recognition that the veterans already have 
This will require large new infusions of money and electoral alliances with interest groups who can supply it 
Veteran members -- proven vote-getters -- are much more powerful in relation to special interests than candidates who have to prove Veteran members -- proven vote-getters -- in an uncertain and expensive campaign environment 
Term limitations wo n't improve the functioning of the legislature, either 
People need time to learn People jobs 
Term limitations throw away the benefits of learning from experience 
Inexperienced legislators are less powerful in relation to legislative staff, executive branch bureaucrats and interest-group lobbyists from whom Inexperienced legislators must learn the customs and routines of legislative operations and the stories behind policy proposals 
New people in any complex institution are highly dependent on the people around New people in any complex institution 
Term limitations just shift power from elected officials to the relatively inaccessible officials, bureaucrats and influence peddlers who surround elected officials to the relatively inaccessible officials , bureaucrats 
Why do we assume that new blood is automatically better than old 
Of course we should pay attention to the quality of our legislators and vote against those whose performance we find wanting 
Term limits merely guarantee that the good will disappear along with the bad 
Finally, term limitations wo n't enhance representative democracy 
Just the opposite, since our legislators and vote create an artificial barrier preventing voters from returning to office legislators our legislators and vote might otherwise favor 
Why are we so certain that voters have such terrible judgment that voters need a constitutional restriction keeping voters from voting for incumbents they know and like 
It is hard to see how restricting voters ' alternatives in this arbitrary way can be proposed in the name of representative government or of democracy 
One must conclude that other forces are at work 
More likely, groups and interests that now have a hard time winning against incumbents are seeking term limitations to improve groups and interests that now have a hard time winning against incumbents chances of winning office 
groups and interests that now have a hard time winning against incumbents are undoubtedly calculating that non-incumbents are easier to beat, or buy 
groups and interests that now have a hard time winning against incumbents 're probably right about that
