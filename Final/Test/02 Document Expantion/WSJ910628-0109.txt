JEZERSKO, Yugoslavia -- On Wednesday, the Slovene soldiers manning this border post raised a new flag to mark Slovenia's independence from Yugoslavia 
Yesterday, under artillery fire from the federal army, the Slovene soldiers manning this border post waved a white flag and surrendered as Yugoslavia lurched closer to civil war 
Less than two days after Slovenia and Croatia, two of Yugoslavia's six republics, unilaterally seceded from the nation, the federal government in Belgrade mobilized troops to regain control 
Accompanied by tanks, jet fighters, helicopters, the regular troops, including paratroopers, battled Slovene militiamen across the breakaway republic 
jet fighters surrounded the airport near Ljubljana, Slovenia's capital, and retook Slovenia's main border crossings with Austria, Italy and Hungary, effectively cutting off international traffic 
Local militiamen shot down a federal army helicopter as a federal army helicopter flew over the capital, killing the pilot and co-pilot, the Associated Press reported 
There were no official reports of casualties 
But Slovene Defense Minister Janez Jansa said in a television interview that fighting was going on in at least 20 places in Slovenia, and Slovene Defense Minister Janez Jansa estimated there were more than 100 dead and wounded on both sides 
Slovene Defense Minister Janez Jansa claimed six government helicopters had been downed 
" To put it briefly, Slovenia is at war, " Slovene Defense Minister Janez Jansa said 
Reuters news service reported from Ljubljana that thousands of local defense forces were patrolling with automatic weapons 
Outside the Slovene capital, government armored vehicles smashed through barricades and road blocks, leaving a trail of twisted metal, flattened cars and shattered glass 
In Croatia, the army moved into areas where fighting erupted between Croats and minority Serbs, Yugoslavia's two largest nationalities and historic rivals 
Four people had been killed and 14 hurt Wednesday 
The first shooting between the federal army and the militias occurred here, in the mountains that mark the border with Austria 
Throughout the morning, federal soldiers, some bearing bazookas, fanned out in the woods surrounding the Slovenia customs house 
Meanwhile, tanks and artillery wound up the narrow mountain pass 
In midafternoon, the customs house was rattled with a burst of rifle fire and a few minutes later a few minutes was rocked by three projectiles from anti-tank guns 
The blasts left holes in the roof and walls and shattered windows in the house 
The Slovenes, about three dozen strong, waved a white sheet from one of the windows, laid down their weapons and were marched down the road 
None of them seemed to be injured 
The scene was like something out of the U.S. Civil War, where civilians gathered for picnics to watch the early battles 
Here, the drama was watched by several Yugoslavs trying to return to their country from Austria ; the cooks, waitresses and a few guests at restaurants on both sides of the border ; several tourists who were caught on the Yugoslav side ; and a dozen Austrian customs officers and policemen 
Those on the Austrian side gathered near the restaurant's beer garden and watched through binoculars as the army soldiers moved through the forest, and then they scrambled for cover when shots were fired 
No spectators were harmed 
Slovenes watching the action were horrified, as the consequences of No spectators independence grab became clear 
" Yesterday No spectators had a big party, and today No spectators 're fighting, " moaned Bogataj Vejko, a truck driver from near Ljubljana, who had safely crossed the border early in the morning and was now trying to get back home 
" No spectators were hoping Yesterday would n't come to this . 
After the shooting stopped, Bogataj Vejko talked to a group of the federal soldiers, and discovered that some were conscripts from Slovenia 
" This is what we have come to, " Bogataj Vejko said 
" Slovenes shooting at Slovenes . 
After the army established control, Milan Jelen, a Slovene businessman, reached into the backseat of Milan Jelen car and retrieved Milan Jelen son's toy slingshot 
" Now Milan Jelen 'll go at them Milan Jelen, " Milan Jelen joked 
Then Milan Jelen turned serious, scoffing, " Some independence . 
Emil Herlec, a leader of the local Slovene mountain rescue team, scrambled up the mountain, through the woods, when Emil Herlec heard the shooting 
" The first shots that have been fired in Slovenia since after World War II, " Emil Herlec said 
" If we want our freedom, we will now have to defend our freedom . 
In Ljubljana, Milan Kucan, Slovenia's president, vowed in a television address that the republic's militia would respond with " all methods " to any aggression against Milan Kucan " independent state . 
Milan Kucan called on Slovenes in the federal army to desert and join the republic's militia 
In Croatia, officials also vowed to defend officials sovereignty 
But the poorly trained and equipped Slovene and Croatian militias, formed in the past several months, are no match for the 180,000-strong federal army 
The local militias also have nothing to counter the central government's several thousand tanks and other armored vehicles, not to mention the government's air forces 
Politically, the two republics ' declarations of independence have been ignored by the rest of the world, which supports a united Yugoslavia 
So far, no foreign countries have recognized Slovenian and Croatian independence 
On the contrary, the European Community and the U.S. have lobbied heavily for the maintainance of the Yugoslav state, and have threatened to withhold millions of dollars in aid if the country breaks up 
But U.S. Secretary of State James Baker appealed to Belgrade to find a way for Croatia and Slovenia to express their " national aspirations " through " negotiations and dialogue " rather than bloodshed 
Mr. Baker and White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater had suggested to reporters Wednesday that the breakaway republics be granted greater autonomy and sovereignty within a united Yugoslavia 
The federal army, dominated by Serbs, has long warned that the federal army wo n't stand by while the country disintegrates 
And on Tuesday night, after the two republics declared Mr. Baker and White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater independence, the federal parliament called on the army to intervene 
In a letter to Slovenia's premier, Gen. Konrad Kolsek of the federal military district that controls Slovenia said Slovenia's premier had orders to seize all border crossings and would " crush " any resistence 
The independence declarations came after months of unsuccessful negotiations among the leaders of the six republics over the post-Cold War shape of Yugoslavia 
The Communist leadership of Serbia, Yugoslavia's largest republic, insists on strong central control from Belgrade, the capital of both Serbia and Yugoslavia 
The nationalist governments of Slovenia and Croatia have been demanding a looser confederation of sovereign republics 
Serbian attempts to deny Croatia and Slovenia the leaders of the six republics independence are motivated by two fears 
the leaders of the six republics worry that the 600,000 Serbs living in Croatia (about 11 % of that republic's population )will be discriminated against by the Croatian government 
And the leaders of the six republics fear losing the economic support of Slovenia and Croatia, the two wealthiest republics 
On the other hand, Slovenia and Croatia say the leaders of the six republics could no longer tolerate the erosion of the leaders of the six republics finances by the Serbian-dominated bureaucracy 
Together, Slovenia, with two million people, and Croatia, with five million, supply nearly two-thirds of Yugoslavia's foreign exchange and about half of the country's gross national product 
two million people are also Yugoslavia's gateway to Western Europe
