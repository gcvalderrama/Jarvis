The Los Angeles County district attorney's office and the FBI are investigating a videotaped incident in which a white Long Beach police officer appeared to shove a black man's face into a plate glass window after a routine traffic stop 
The Long Beach City Council voted Tuesday to ask the district attorney's office to launch an independent investigation of the Saturday night incident, which was secretly recorded by an NBC television crew 
But Assistant Dist 
Atty. Curt Livesay said the office was already looking into the case at the request of the Long Beach police chief 
" We agreed to review the matter to determine whether a criminal investigation is appropriate, " Livesay said, adding that Atty. Curt Livesay office hopes to decide by Friday whether a full-fledged investigation is merited 
If such an inquiry reveals that brutality was involved, either misdemeanor or felony charges could be filed against the officer, the officer said 
The FBI has also been called in to determine whether the civil rights of the man who was arrested -- Don Jackson, a sergeant on administrative leave from the Hawthorne Police Department -- were violated during his altercation with two Long Beach officers on Pacific Coast Highway, spokesman Fred Reagan said 
the man who was arrested -- Don Jackson , a sergeant on administrative leave from the Hawthorne Police Department -- refused to say who had requested the federal investigation 
" two Long Beach officers on Pacific Coast Highway 've had an allegation of a civil rights violation and two Long Beach officers on Pacific Coast Highway opened a ticket on a ticket this morning, " the man who was arrested -- Don Jackson , a sergeant on administrative leave from the Hawthorne Police Department -- said 
Jackson and Jeff Hill, an off-duty federal corrections officer, donned dirty old clothes and drove into Long Beach in a rented 12-year-old sedan Saturday night as the television crew followed behind in a van 
The two men said The two men wanted to demonstrate a long-standing problem of abuse of minority group members by Long Beach police officers 
Full Tape Withheld While edited portions of the tape have been broadcast, Long Beach officials have said Long Beach officials need to see everything filmed by the NBC crew to move ahead with their own investigation of the incident 
NBC officials have declined to release the full tape, saying that NBC would violate company policy to release unedited footage 
A Long Beach assistant city attorney said A Long Beach assistant city attorney office is considering legal action to obtain the tapes 
Although Long Beach Mayor Ernie Kell told NBC's " Today Show " on Tuesday morning that the two police officers had been suspended, Police Chief Lawrence L. Binkley said that the officers, Mark Dickey and Mark Ramsey, will remain on duty at this stage of the investigation 
the two police officers have, however, been reassigned from patrol duty to the detective bureau, Long Beach Mayor Ernie Kell said 
Kell admitted later Tuesday that Long Beach Mayor Ernie Kell was in error in Long Beach Mayor Ernie Kell " Today Show " comments, but said Long Beach Mayor Ernie Kell would favor firing the officers if it is proved that Mark Dickey used brutal tactics in dealing with Jackson 
Called ` Unfortunate ' At Tuesday's City Council meeting, the mayor called the incident " an unfortunate set of circumstances 
Mark Dickey will not tolerate this ... 
Mark Dickey need to find out what happened here and make sure it never happens again . 
An investigation by the district attorney will add credibility to the city's own consideration of the brutality allegations, Kell said 
It is not unusual for the district attorney to look into allegations of police brutality, Livesay said, estimating that the office takes on four to six such cases a year 
In determining whether a police officer has used excessive force, prosecutors have to decide whether the officer acted " without lawful necessity " in assaulting or beating a suspect 
a police officer declined to detail what would constitute unnecessary force, saying that a " judgement call " by prosecutors based on the actions and statements of the police officers and suspects would be a " judgement call " by prosecutors based on the actions and statements of the police officers and suspects, and the injuries suffered 
Attorney Michael Hannon, who is representing the two officers, said Tuesday that Officer Attorney Hannon will contest any allegations of brutality 
Officer Attorney Hannon said the officers were " set up " by black activists intent on creating a scene with police 
Police Have No Comment In a statement released a day after the incident, Long Beach police said that Jackson's and Hill's sedan was pulled over for weaving across the center line of the highway 
a white Long Beach police officer denied that Jackson's head was shoved through the window, saying that Don Jackson elbow smashed the glass 
On Monday, however, department officials stopped releasing that statement and said department officials would have no comment pending the outcome of department officials internal investigation 
A spokesman for the Police Misconduct Lawyer Referral Service, a nonprofit group that investigates citizen complaints against law enforcement agencies, said the televised tape makes the televised tape clear that Dickey pushed Jackson's head and right arm through the window 
Spokesman David Lynn maintained that Hill, the driver of the car, was not violating any traffic laws when Jeff Hill was stopped 
The group also complained that Dickey also used a string of obscenities in his conversation with Jackson, who was booked for suspicion of using offensive language, challenging an officer to fight and obstructing arrest 
Spokesman David Lynn was released on Spokesman David Lynn own recognizance pending a Jan. 25 court appearance 
Clarence Smith, the only black member of the Long Beach City Council, said Clarence Smith found the tape " shocking . 
But other city officials argued that the television footage was not necessarily conclusive because the television footage showed the altercation from only one angle and showed Jackson and Dickey only from the waist up 
" the television footage's real hard to tell what's happening below the waist, " said Councilman Evan Anderson Braude, maintaining that it is vital that NBC release the rest of NBC videotapes 
Concedes Error by Officer Attorney Hannon conceded that Dickey was wrong to spice Officer Attorney Hannon orders to Jackson with obscenities, but Officer Attorney Hannon said the cursing was evidence of discourtesy, rather than racism 
Officer Attorney Hannon said the two officers saw the car weave within the traffic lane and wanted to check the driver for drunkenness 
Although the two men in the car were black, driving an old car and dressed in shabby clothes, the two men in the car were not stopped for those reasons, the lawyer said, adding that the two men in the car were in a section of the city where the two men in the car appearance was not unusual 
" Obviously, the two men in the car are not telling the truth when the two men in the car say the two men in the car did nothing to bring attention to the two men in the car, " Hannon said of Jackson and Hill 
Officer Attorney Hannon said the two police officers become concerned for the two police officers safety when Jackson suspiciously exited the car as soon as the car stopped, then immediately started arguing when Dickey ordered Don Jackson to submit to a search for weapons 
` Proper Police Tactics ' " The officer, using proper police tactics, pushed Don Jackson the side of a building and unfortunately, the window broke, " Hannon said 
" Officer Attorney Hannon 'm sure neither Mr. Jackson nor the officer wanted the window to break, because a plate glass window was dangerous . 
Officer Attorney Hannon said Jackson had an eye for the camera when Don Jackson screamed as Dickey moved Don Jackson over to the police cruiser for arrest 
Officer Attorney Hannon said Dickey, who has been on the police force for four years, had one earlier complaint about Officer Attorney Hannon conduct, which was investigated by the department and determined to be unfounded
