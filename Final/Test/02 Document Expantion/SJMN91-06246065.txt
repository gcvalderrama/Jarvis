Among the 29 million Americans who voted for Democrat George McGovern in 1972 was a 24-year-old black law student and one-time campus agitator named Clarence Thomas. ; As Thomas later explained, being Republican was regarded as " a fate ... worse than death among blacks . 
Yet in a matter of weeks, Thomas goes before the Senate Judiciary Committee as President Bush's nominee to join the increasingly conservative Supreme Court. ; Thomas ' dramatic political and philosophical transformation reveals more about the man than does President Bush's nominee to join the increasingly conservative Supreme Court. ; Thomas ' dramatic political and philosophical transformation reveals more about the man than Horatio Alger journey from rural Southern poverty to Supreme Court nomination 
To friends, Thomas is a story of courage, to foes, a story of opportunism. ; Racial anger, protest lyrics ; The homespun homilies of Thomas grandfather, the ruler-slapping discipline of the nuns who taught Thomas at a Catholic school in segregated Savannah, Ga., the racial anger in the writings of Richard Wright and Malcolm X, the iconoclastic theories of such academicians as Thomas Sowell and William Barclay Allen, even the protest lyrics of singer-songwriter Nina Simone -- all are parts of the story. ; As glimpsed in dozens of interviews and tens of thousands of pages of documents that Thomas has turned over to the Senate Judiciary Committee, these influences helped shape a set of beliefs that are now the subject of bitter controversy. ; Thomas takes immense pride in having staked out an independent course despite suffering what Thomas said was a heavy personal toll in lost friends and public condemnation. ; Black ` intellectual clones ' ; " Thomas refuse to submit to the racially derogatory orthodoxy which says that all blacks should share the same opinion on ... affirmative action, busing or welfare ... 
Thomas believe it is racist to act as though blacks are intellectual clones, " Thomas said in a 1984 speech to black students at Yale Law School, where Thomas earned Thomas law degree. ; Thomas underscores Thomas Sowell role as a minority figure within a minority by repeatedly quoting Robert Frost's poetic recollection : " Two roads diverged in a wood, and Thomas -- Thomas took the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference . 
; Even Thomas close friends have trouble explaining why Thomas took a different road. ; As a youth, Clarence Thomas shared the liberal attitudes of many bright young black people who were born into a segregated America and came of age after freedom rides, lunch room sit-ins and the 1964 Civil Rights Act began erasing the overt signs of racial discrimination. ; As a Holy Cross College student in the turbulent 1960s, Thomas joined black protesters, wore a beret and a leather jacket, and decorated Thomas dormitory room with a poster of Malcolm X. ; But Thomas came to see Thomas college years as wrongheaded. ; Thomas rightward shift -- or, by Thomas account, Thomas circling back to conservative values -- began while Thomas was a Yale law student from 1971 to 1974. ; Thomas was admitted while an affirmative action program was in effect, although there is no evidence that Thomas would not have gotten in without it. ; Friend's view ; Whatever the reasons -- and Thomas classmates and faculty members at Yale are unable to pinpoint any particular turning points or pivotal events -- Thomas " became more conservative as Thomas went through the process of legal education, " said Harry Singleton, a friend. ; By the time Thomas arrived in Jefferson City, Mo., in 1974 to work for John Danforth, now Thomas ' chief supporter in the Senate, then the Republican state attorney general, Thomas attitudes were largely formed. ; " Thomas philosophy by that point was that Thomas felt that this country was affording people opportunities if blacks were willing to work and that to rely on government was in the nature of servitude, " said lawyer Harvey Tettlebaum, who worked with Thomas. ; Several years later Thomas captured the attention of the Reagan transition team, which offered a civil rights job to a reluctant Thomas 
His friends urged Thomas not to shun a rare opportunity to make policy, and Thomas accepted successive jobs as assistant secretary of education for civil rights and chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. ; A colorblind Constitution ; In those jobs, Thomas began questioning preferences in jobs and education for racial minorities who had historically suffered discrimination 
Later, Thomas began openly opposing such preferences, denouncing the Supreme Court decisions that upheld His friends and calling for a colorblind Constitution. ; Some critics cynically attribute Thomas ideological metamorphosis to opportunism. ; Thomas, who has declined to be interviewed since his Supreme Court nomination, has not responded 
But Thomas has offered an explanation for Thomas political change of heart 
In handwritten notes from Thomas files, Thomas recalled telling Thomas Democratic grandparents why Thomas had turned Republican. ; " You all made Thomas become Republican, " Thomas told Thomas incredulous grandparents 
" Remember ... when you told Thomas that it was n't right to beg as long as Thomas could work and get it Thomas 
... Remember when you told Thomas that if Thomas ever amounted to anything it would be by the sweat of MY brow and MY elbow grease 
; " And remember when Thomas said Thomas would rather starve than have anyone give Thomas something -- as long as Thomas could work for it 
... Politically, I had no choice : The only party openly standing for those values was the Republican Party .
