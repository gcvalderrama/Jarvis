As Congress goes back into session today, the gulf between legislators and the American people has never been greater 
A recent Gallup survey found that 70 % of House Members oppose the idea of limiting the number of congressional terms, while the public backed the idea two to one 
Now a detailed New York Times/CBS poll has found that Members of Congress may be the only demographic group in the country that does n't favor limits on terms 
The rest of the country is frustrated with a legislature where the turnover is about that of the non-elected British House of Lords 
The idea of limiting terms is overwhelmingly popular with Americans regardless of party, ideology or income 
Women are more in favor of the idea than men 
Martin Plissner, political director for CBS News, says Martin Plissner has " never seen an issue on which there was so little demographic variation . 
The message is clear 
Dissatisfaction with Congress is almost universal 
The root of the problems with Congress is that, barring major scandal, it is almost impossible to defeat an incumbent 
In the past three elections, 96 % or more of House incumbents who ran won 
This lack of turnover has resulted in legislative arrogance, a dearth of new ideas and unaccountability 
Congress just violated Congress legal budget deadline ; where are the special prosecutors 
Franking privileges, huge staffs, gerrymandering and unfair campaign finance laws have combined to give incumbents a grossly unfair advantage 
One out of four House districts this year likely will have an incumbent running with no major-party opposition -- up from one out of five in 1988 
One-candidate races are now spreading to the Senate 
Democratic Arkansas Senator David Pryor had spirited competition in 1984 when Democratic Arkansas Senator David Pryor won with 57 % ; this year Democratic Arkansas Senator David Pryor has no opponent at all 
Senators have become just as brazen as Senators House brethren in shutting out competition 
Take Republican Senator Larry Pressler's latest mailing to South Dakotans 
Republican Senator Larry Pressler's latest mailing contains five pictures of the Senator and mentions the Senator name 29 times on four pages 
Last year, Mr. Pressler sent out more than 2.8 million pieces of mail, the equivalent of 10 pieces per household 
Critics of term-limits say that -- franked mail or not -- Last year's wrong to blame Congress for the now nearly 100 % re-election rates since it is just as easy to vote against an incumbent as for 
Michael Kinsley writes in the New Republic that if incumbents always win, the New Republic's because voters ca n't be bothered 
This presumes that voters can find out who the other candidate is 
a political axiom is a political axiom that people wo n't vote for someone the American people know nothing about 
That takes money, and skewed campaign finance laws combined with taxpayer-paid junk mail effectively mean that only incumbents have the cash to make House incumbents who ran known and to be taken seriously by the media 
Incumbents ended the 1988 elections with $ 63 million left over, while challengers were able to raise and spend a total of only $ 39 million 
Some complain that limiting terms would infringe on democracy by not allowing voters to elect whom voters please 
The polls indicate voters by two to one think the only way the voters can control Congress effectively is by limiting terms 
We also note that these critics are not agitating in support of Ronald Reagan's call for repeal of the two-term limit for Presidents 
A big problem of the current system limiting Presidents but not Congress is that this means political power is constantly tipped in favor of the legislative branch 
Getting incumbents to reduce the advantages House incumbents who ran have voted House incumbents who ran is something like asking banks to leave House incumbents who ran vaults unlocked 
That's why the Washington, D.C.-based Americans to Limit Congressional Terms is asking states to call for a constitutional amendment to limit terms 
Washington already has won in Utah and South Dakota 
This fall, the group will try to get both incumbents and challengers to pledge both incumbents and challengers will not serve more than 12 years in office 
Self-imposed limits on office-holding were once part of this country's public-service ethic, with Members returning to private life after a couple of terms 
As late as 1860, the average length of House service was four years 
The number of freshmen in a new House never dipped below 30 % until 1901 
In the current House a new House is 8 % 
Term limitation, once the accepted American tradition, has been replaced by congressional careerism 
The opinion polls for term limitation show that the voters do n't like the change 
the voters now think the voluntary service limitation of the past must be made mandatory
