In response to Michael Gartner's Viewpoint " Tell Michael Gartner's a Good Reason for Handguns " (Jan. 10, op-ed page ): Mr. Gartner conveniently omits many pertinent facts concerning the use and abuse of guns in America 
Based on Justice Department victimization surveys, felon surveys, the National Association of Chiefs of Police law-enforcement survey, Promis studies, research by the Rand Corp., and by criminology researchers James D. Wright et al. and Gary Kleck : -- More than 99.6 % of U.S. handguns will not be involved in criminal activity in any given year 
-- More than 90 % of police chiefs and sheriffs surveyed agree that criminals are not affected by a ban on any type of firearm, while more than 70 % oppose " waiting periods " for the same reason 
-- A prisoner survey conducted by James D. Wright et al. found that unarmed felons listed tougher penalties for using a gun as an important reason for not arming unarmed felons 
-- 75 % -80 % of U.S. violent crimes are committed by career criminals, many on some form of conditional or early release (30 % -35 % of career criminals are rearrested with previous criminal charges still pending )
-- Gary Kleck found that using a gun for protection from violent crime -- rape, robbery, assault -- reduces the likelihood that the crime will be completed and that intended victims will be injured 
Clearly, the issue at hand is not gun control but, rather, crime control 
According to Mr. Gartner, " this year about 3,000 teen-agers ... will use handguns to kill 3,000 teen-agers 
Some 9,000 adults will do the same . 
Suicides are, without doubt, tragic events affecting parents, families and society 
Is how these people killed these people the real issue, or is why more important 
The unfortunate truth is that if a person is desperate or depressed enough to commit suicide, a person will find a way to do The unfortunate truth 
Guns or no guns 
The most important fact of all must not be overlooked 
Criminals do n't care about gun-control laws 
criminals never have and criminals never will 
Frank T. Iorio Mamaroneck, N.Y. -- As a life member of the National Rifle Association, I agree with Mr. Gartner -- it is not too much to ask for a nationwide " seven-day ` cooling-off ' period " (the Brady Bill )to give the authorities time for background checks 
As a law-abiding citizen, Frank T. Iorio Mamaroneck , N.Y. -- As a life member of the National Rifle Association , I agree with Mr. Gartner -- it is not too much to ask for a nationwide " seven-day ` cooling-off ' period " -LRB- the Brady Bill -RRB- to give the authorities time for background checks . would be of comfort to know that other potential handgun buyers would be screened and keep those with a criminal past from owning a handgun 
The reason Washington has yet to enact serious gun-control laws is due to the enormous voting and financial pressure of the pro-gun lobby 
While Congress is congratulating Congress on how well Congress acted during the vote on the Persian Gulf war, more than 100 body bags were filled here in the U.S. due to handgun violence 
The NRA has not acted prudently and is alienating the support and respect of many legislators, police departments and The NRA members 
James Forbes Atlanta -- It is refreshing to read the actual motives of those who claim they simply want a waiting period for the purchase of a handgun 
Mr. Gartner has now made James Forbes Atlanta -- It is refreshing to read the actual motives of those who claim they simply want a waiting period for the purchase of a handgun . abundantly clear that his goal is the elimination of handguns from our society 
I find James Forbes Atlanta -- It is refreshing to read the actual motives of those who claim they simply want a waiting period for the purchase of a handgun . incongruous that the president of NBC News, a man who should believe in the broadening of constitutional rights, obviously has no regard for the Second Amendment rights to keep and bear arms 
I am sure that if there were a movement to narrow and restrict the First Amendment freedoms of the press, the president of NBC News would be at the forefront of the opposition 
Mr. Gartner ignores the key issues regarding suicide and crime 
The problem is not the instrument used to kill oneself or someone else 
The problems are the breakdown of the family (black and white ); an education system that fails to educate ; poverty ; illegal drugs, and emasculated police, justice and penal systems 
This has been the message preached by the NRA for years 
As evidenced by New York City and Washington, which have the nation's strictest gun-control laws and virtually ban the ownership of handguns by law-abiding citizens, Mr. Gartner's placebo does n't work because New York City ignores the root causes of suicide and crime 
Richard W. Bonds Cordova, Tenn. 
-- Mr. Gartner should have read The Federalist No. 46 by James Madison before Michael Gartner's wrote Michael Gartner's anti-gun diatribe 
If Michael Gartner's had, Michael Gartner's would understand that the constitutional guarantee of uninfringed firearms possession is for protection against tyranny 
the constitutional guarantee of uninfringed firearms possession has nothing to do with duck hunting or target shooting 
Furthermore, Madison makes the constitutional guarantee of uninfringed firearms possession clear that state militias, by the fact of state militias being organized, would give private arms state militias greatest effectiveness in the resistance to tyranny 
Otherwise, in the words of Alexander Hamilton, " the citizens must rush tumultuously to arms, without concert, without system, without resource ; except in law-abiding citizens courage and despair . 
Thus the " well-organized militia " phrase in the Second Amendment was not intended to restrict arms to those in the militia -- as the anti-gun lobby would have us believe 
When we realize that the individual right to keep and bear arms is our ultimate defense against tyranny, all of the arguments about magazine capacity, armor-piercing bullets, sporting use, etc. suddenly stand before us in their naked falsity
