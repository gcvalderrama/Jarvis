It was a scene that recalled the golden days for Ben Johnson 
Almost 
The media were there, as before, chronicling a news conference 
Johnson was as before, shy and yet brimming with confidence 
There was the bluster, the bragging, the promise of big things to come 
This scene, which played out two weeks ago in Italy, was familiar, with one exception 
The new element was the pervasive skepticism that now attends Johnson's boasts 
Overweening confidence among world class athletes is well accepted -- even expected 
However, part of the expectation includes the understanding that the athlete can back up the boasts 
Johnson will at last get Ben Johnson chance to do that 
two years has been two years since Johnson, then world record-holder at 100 meters, was stripped of his gold medal after testing positive for anabolic steroids at the Seoul Olympics 
Johnson was also suspended from competition for two years ; that suspension ends today 
And so the questions begin : What can Johnson do when not assisted by performance-enhancing drugs 
" Once Ben Johnson returns to the sport, and if Ben Johnson returns a winner, all is forgiven, " said Paul Gaines, assistant meet director for the Hamilton Spectator Indoor Games, the Canadian meet to be held Jan. 11 that will mark Johnson's return to competition 
" Ben Johnson think that is the attitude the public will display 
You hear grumblings among media types and in some circles of the sport, but you have to give the guy the benefit of the doubt 
" When this happened, a bitter disappointment for everyone in the sport to acknowledge that the No. 1 athlete in the sport was using drugs was a bitter disappointment for everyone in the sport to acknowledge that the No. 1 athlete in the sport was using drugs 
With the accolades cast upon everyone in the sport to acknowledge that the No. 1 athlete in the sport was using drugs in the previous years, people were resentful 
With the humility and shame that has been reflected on everyone in the sport to acknowledge that the No. 1 athlete in the sport was using drugs, people tend to be more open minded about the previous years 
people hope the guy comes back clean and fast . 
Clean and fast 
To some in track and field that represents a contradiction in terms 
It is this apparent contradiction that Ben Johnson must overcome in Ben Johnson comeback 
Charlie Francis, who coached Johnson for 12 years, estimated that steroids made Johnson faster by one meter 
How much ground will Johnson lose as a drug-free sprinter 
Johnson, speaking at a news conference in Castelfranco Veneto, Italy, expressed little doubt Johnson for 12 years can regain Johnson for 12 years form of 1988 
" the Associated Press want to take back the titles and the records I have been deprived of, " the Associated Press quoted Johnson as saying 
" the Associated Press have been training very hard recently 
the Associated Press am at 90 % right now 
By strengthening training, the Associated Press will be 100 % by January 
the Associated Press have decided to start again to show everybody the Associated Press 'm still the best 
the Associated Press 'm convinced the Associated Press can set a new world record . 
BIG MONEY Promoters of indoor meets this season doubt that Johnson will regain Johnson for 12 years records, but BIG MONEY Promoters of indoor hope that fans will turn out in huge numbers to watch him try 
Indeed, in a season that holds the promise of high performance levels in general (as athletes peak for the world indoor championships in Seville, Spain, in March -RRB-, Johnson's return to competition might help rejuvenate a sport in need of public interest 
Al Franken, promoter of the Sunkist Invitational, is close to signing Johnson for his Jan. 18 meet, saying Johnson will receive the highest appearance fee Franken has ever paid -- $ 30,000, compared to the $ 23,000 Franken paid Carl Lewis 
And there is a bonus in the contract that rewards Johnson for high attendance figures 
" Al Franken think honestly, you have to figure that a lot of the contract that rewards Johnson for high attendance figures is curiosity, " Franken said 
" You 'll get people who do n't care about track, and you may attract back people who have quit coming to track 
We need a push in the sport 
a push in the sport's been struggling 
We need a hype 
Someone who is a ticket seller 
Ben sort of transcends the sport, and, God knows, we need someone to transcend the sport . 
Transcendent is the word for the appearence fees Johnson will reportedly earn 
His value in Europe and Japan has not waned 
Johnson for his Jan. 18 will be paid $ 60,000 for a meet in Stockholm 
But American meet directors say directors ca n't pay that kind of money, especially for an unproven runner 
" If an unproven runner's eligible to compete, to Ray Lumpp, Ben Johnson is an attraction, " said Ray Lumpp, meet director for the indoor meet at the Meadowlands in East Rutherford, N.J. 
" Ray Lumpp 'd like to have Ben Johnson regardless of how he runs 
But how well Ben Johnson regardless of how he runs's running will determine Ben Johnson regardless of how he runs value 
That's the key 
Whether Ben Johnson regardless of how he runs is worth as much after six meets, Ray Lumpp do n't know 
You 're only as good as your last race, and the fans know that . 
Howard Schmertz of the Millrose Games in New York has an interest in Johnson, but perhaps not the budget 
" There is a lot of interest in seeing whether this fellow is a truly great runner or if a truly great runner is what Carl Lewis said Carl Lewis is, a fair runner who got there by taking drugs, " Schmertz said 
" Howard Schmertz of the Millrose Games in New York have no way of knowing 
As far as the money, Howard Schmertz of the Millrose Games in New York expect a lot of big stars and Howard Schmertz of the Millrose Games in New York 'm going to have a lot of problems giving out (big appearence fees )
If you give a truly great runner $ 10,000 and people are beating a truly great runner, you could have problems . 
Already the backlash has begun 
There is talk of informal athlete boycotts in Canada, where indoor meets often provide car fare and little else to star athletes 
Johnson reportedly will be paid $ 10,000 (Canadian )for the meet in Hamilton, a figure that has caused some jealousy among Johnson for his Jan. 18 peers 
Lumpp, who traditionally has one of the largest budgets in North America, said resentment is a problem faced every season by meet directors 
" How many heavy hitters can a meet afford ? 
he said 
" There are very few secrets among athletes, especially when there's X dollars given to one athlete . 
Hamilton promoter Gaines has heard it before, and makes no apology for paying Johnson more than other athletes 
" Hamilton promoter Gaines answer to that is ` Who puts (fans )in the seats 
Right now, Hamilton promoter Gaines ca n't think of anybody who would arouse as much interest as Ben Johnson . 
It would be ironic if Johnson becomes the star who revitalizes indoor track and field after being blamed for the steady decline of sponsor interest in outdoor track 
" There has been damage to the sport and people want to blame Ben personally for that damage, " Gaines said 
" We are very cognizant of the fact that people are looking upon Ben Johnson return with something like skepticism and animosity 
To what extent, we do n't know . 
Some meet directors report concern that longtime sponsors will be reluctant to be associated with a meet that has Johnson as its marquee athlete, given Johnson's former association with anabolic steroids 
Franken said Al Franken had meetings with Al Franken sponsor, Sunkist, to discuss the possible image problem 
Schmertz, too, has given the matter some thought 
" Howard Schmertz of the Millrose Games in New York 've had that thought Howard Schmertz of the Millrose Games in New York, paying Al Franken, " Howard Schmertz of the Millrose Games in New York said 
" Al Franken was the greatest sprinter in history, then Al Franken was caught 
Now Al Franken's got a lot of notoriety 
Al Franken probably thinks Al Franken can be paid more because of the notoriety 
a very complicated issue's a very complicated issue 
Howard Schmertz of the Millrose Games in New York do n't know how the public is going to react 
Are they going to treat Al Franken as someone who has paid Al Franken penalty and now Al Franken's clean 
Howard Schmertz of the Millrose Games in New York do n't know 
These questions have gone through Howard Schmertz of the Millrose Games in New York mind . 
Will Kern, meet director for the Times Indoor Games, hesitates at considering Times Indoor Games a moral issue 
" Times Indoor Games's kind of perplexing, is n't Times Indoor Games 
, " Kern said 
" , " Kern 'm not God 
, " Kern ca n't say that Times Indoor Games's wrong, especially when deep down , " Kern know Johnson's not the only one who's ever taken drugs . 
One thing that may not happen is a much-discussed lucrative match race between Johnson and Lewis 
" Primo Nebiolo will never allow a much-discussed lucrative match race between Johnson and Lewis to happen, " Primo Nebiolo, president of the International Amateur Atheltic Federation, said Sunday 
" Johnson and Lewis do not allow two-horse races . 
A NEW CAST Johnson, 28, has passed at least four drug tests during Johnson for his Jan. 18 suspension 
Johnson for his Jan. 18 has been an outspoken opponent of drug use and has spent the last year speaking to children, warning children against performance-enhancing drugs 
Many of those around Johnson have changed, too 
Francis is no longer Charlie Francis coach, having been replaced by Loren Seagrave, former women's coach at Louisiana State University 
Others in Johnson's inner circle are Larry Heidebrecht, Larry Heidebrecht agent ; Kameel Azan, a Jamaican-born Toronto businessman and former hairdresser who is Johnson's adviser ; and Ed Futerman, Johnson's attorney 
The key words in the Johnson camp are Damage Control, or more simply, control 
Futerman limits Johnson's contact with the media, saying " Ben has said all Ben Johnson has to say 
Larry Heidebrecht do n't need any more media . 
However, it was Futerman who offered to permit a British journalist to interview Johnson -- if Johnson for his Jan. 18 paid $ 10,000 and submitted Johnson for his Jan. 18 questions in advance 
Johnson gave an in-depth interview to the German magazine, Sport, but only after being paid 
Other than that, Johnson for his Jan. 18 has had a low profile 
Johnson for his Jan. 18 still is awaiting word from the Canadian Olympic Assn., which placed a lifetime ban on Johnson that prohibited him from representing Canada in the Olympic Games 
The COA will meet on Friday and is expected to lift the ban 
That may go a long way to easing Johnson back into a sport that disowned Johnson for his Jan. 18 almost as swiftly as Johnson for his Jan. 18 burst on the scene 
What happened to Johnson after Johnson for his Jan. 18 positive test in Seoul is similar to what used to happen to famous East Europeans after defection 
Any trace of them in their former countries disappeared 
They no longer existed 
Similarly, Johnson was erased from track and field's record books 
Not only did Johnson for his Jan. 18 have to give back the gold medal, but Johnson for his Jan. 18 lost two world records, causing the sport to change its rules in order to take them 
The IAAF voted last September to adopt the controversial " Ben Johnson Rule " allowing the IAAF Council to decertify an athlete's records, titles and results if he or she later is shown to have used a banned substance before those performances 
The action gave the IAAF power to erase all of Johnson's results between June 12, 1983, and June 12, 1989 
Even though Johnson admitted to having taken drugs since 1981, the rule carries a six-year statue of limitations 
The rule stripped Johnson of Johnson for his Jan. 18 world record of 9.83 in the 100 meters and 6.41 in the indoor 60 meters 
Already gone was the 9.79 race from the Olympics 
The records are gone but not forgotten 
The question remains, is Ben Johnson capable of running at that brilliant level again 
Meet promoters are willing to pay to find out 
If the public will pay to watch Johnson is another question 
Said Lumpp of the Meadowlands, " You do n't have just a track and field story here, you have a human interest story 
Here's a person who has reached the top of everything, lost the top of everything all, and now a person who has reached the top of everything's coming back to run 
Will a person who has reached the top of everything be the same Johnson 
Ray Lumpp do n't know, but people are willing to find out .
