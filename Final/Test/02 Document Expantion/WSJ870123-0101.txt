In his State of the Union address last January, President Reagan announced that welfare reform would be a priority of his administration in welfare reform final three years 
He instructed his charges to draw up plans for " immediate action " that would enable poor families to achieve " real and lasting emancipation " from welfare dependency 
" The success of welfare, " he said, " should be judged by how many of The success of welfare recipients become independent of welfare . 
The president's convincing message raised hopes that something would finally be done to break the cycle of poverty and dependency that afflicts several million welfare families 
Americans have become increasingly exasperated by the enormous amount of money the federal government devotes each year to anti-poverty programs, with little apparent abatement in poverty 
The president correctly sensed that the public wants reform 
If the president lets up on welfare reform, The president's will disappoint those whose hopes The president's raised last January, a group that surely includes many of the poor who understand better than any politician how deficient the current system is 
To build on the momentum The president's created a year ago, the president must make plain The president's commitment in the State of the Union message next Tuesday 
To pull away now would be to undercut the welfare-reform movement just as the welfare-reform movement has hit the welfare-reform movement stride 
The president ought to challenge Congress to respond to The president's initiatives 
His Domestic Policy Council has drafted a blueprint 
His Domestic Policy Council would give the states wider latitude to experiment with welfare programs 
Many of the governors seem to like the plan, as they have already unveiled their own proposals for welfare reform 
The president and the governors should be natural allies on this issue, and the chances of success would be enhanced if natural allies on this issue could jointly commit natural allies on this issue to a plan of action 
The president will need all the help The president's can get if The president's is to convince Democrats in Congress to go along 
Most have paid lip service to the idea of welfare reform but nary a bill has been put on the docket 
This suggests that the Democrats are n't as serious about welfare reform as the governors and the American public are 
There is a reason for this 
The Democrats have long been beholden to the welfare lobby, whose interests now have less to do with alleviating poverty than with enlarging the welfare bureaucracy 
This past December, a coalition of some 80 organizations, most with headquarters in Washington, issued a " statement of principles " calling for increased spending for poverty and jobs programs 
It also insisted that the federal government has " primary responsibility " for operating welfare 
Congressional Democrats seem to be in agreement with the welfare lobby 
However, the public wants the system changed 
It will be difficult for Congress to sell restored or additional spending on current poverty programs when the American people are already spending more than $ 100 billion a year on these programs 
The president should take up The president's case for reform directly with the American people 
With the alliance of reform-minded governors and the support of the public, the president can press Congress to move off the deadening status quo 
With the ball in its court, Congress can decide either to work with the president and the governors, or the ball in its court can continue to place the interests of the welfare lobby ahead of the interests of the poor
