Volcker, Greenspan has developed close ties to the White House and has quietly become a key economic adviser to President Bush. ; Greenspan's influence over White House economic policy became clear during President Bush's State of the Union address, when Bush announced that he was tapping Greenspan to lead a new commission to study a controversial proposal to cut the tax rate for capital gains. ; The appointment will plunge Greenspan -- himself a strong supporter of a cut in capital gains tax rates -- directly into the middle of a raging political debate between the president and Congress over tax policy. ; By any standard, Fed-watchers say Greenspan is taking on a role that is almost unprecedented in modern times
