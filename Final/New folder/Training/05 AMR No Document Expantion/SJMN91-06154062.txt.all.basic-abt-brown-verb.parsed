# ::snt HE FIGHTING IS OVER, BUT THE LINGERING PAIN OF WAR IS RESHAPING LIVES ACROSS THE REGION WHERE THINGS STAND TODAY IN THE GULF IRAQI President Saddam Hussein has sought to tighten his grip on power by turning over key government roles to trusted family members. ; He has also taken steps to portray Iraq as committed to " democratization " by : ; (check )Holding autonomy talks with Kurdish leaders. ; (check )Abolishing the secret Revolutionary Court. ; (check )Easing restrictions on travel and news organizations. ; (check )Promising to hold elections and disband the ruling Revolutionary Command Council. ; Threatened by the revolts of the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south, as well as rumblings in the army, he has closed his circle around him. ; Since Iraq's defeat, Saddam has adjusted his Cabinet twice, shifting the portfolios of longtime senior officials and promoting others known for their loyalty to him. ; On the surface, the reshuffling looked as if he were moving to democratize. ; In March, for example, he relinquished the title of prime minister and gave it to Saadun Hamadi, a Shiite who has held several important positions in the Baath government. ; Personal loyalty seems to be the litmus test for Saddam's new appointees : ; (check )His cousin, Ali Hassan al-Majid, is minister of interior. ; (check )His half-brother, Sibawi, retains direct control of the intelligence services. ; (check )Son-in-law and former bodyguard Hussein Kamel al-Majid is his minister of defense. ; Publicly, Saddam is seen on Iraqi television presiding over meetings of the Revolutionary Command Council and visiting villages, and he has promised his people to rebuild the country " scores of times " better than what the allied forces destroyed. ; But most experts see Saddam's efforts as aimed at reviving relations with the outside world and at relieving some of the pressure at home
