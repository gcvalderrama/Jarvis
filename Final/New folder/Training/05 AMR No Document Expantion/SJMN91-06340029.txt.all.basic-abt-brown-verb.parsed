Neal addressed Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito, who set sentencing for Feb. 7 and rejected a Hodgman request to raise Keating's bail from $ 100,000 to $ 1 million. ; " As Mr. Neal has indicated, there is the possibility of some imminent action on the federal front, " Hodgman said in arguing that Keating was now an increased flight risk. ; Emotions ran high during the trial, which became a national window into the extravagances and duplicity that contributed to the collapse of the savings and loan industry during the freewheeling 1980s. ; Civil lawsuits contend that after buying Lincoln in 1984, American Continental quickly and illegally began siphoning off federally insured deposits to fund a playground of lofty salaries and company-paid jet-setting for Keating, his family and top officers. ; During the trial, bondholders jeered Keating as he passed them in court hallways
