Volcker, Greenspan has developed close ties to the White House and has quietly become a key economic adviser to President Bush. ; Greenspan's influence over White House economic policy became clear during President Bush's State of the Union address, when Bush announced that he was tapping Greenspan to lead a new commission to study a controversial proposal to cut the tax rate for capital gains. ; The appointment will plunge Greenspan -- himself a strong supporter of a cut in capital gains tax rates -- directly into the middle of a raging political debate between the president and Congress over tax policy. ; By any standard, Fed-watchers say Greenspan is taking on a role that is almost unprecedented in modern times

# ::snt Some close to the president reported that Bush's had all but announced that to intimates in mid-1990. ; Yet now, with the war under way at a time when the recession has yet to abate, Greenspan finds Bush's trying to perform an increasingly difficult balancing act. ; At the same time Bush's is seeking to be a player in setting White House policy, Bush's must also guide the Fed through an economic minefield -- the booby-traps of war, recession, bank failures, soaring budget deficits and crashing consumer confidence. ; Clearly, Greenspan, a longtime Washington insider with good political instincts, hopes to keep economic policy in sync with the nation's military strategy -- hoping to calm both the financial markets and the public in order to help keep the wartime economy stable. ; But critics are cautious about charging that Greenspan is politicizing the Fed in any way. ; " It is hard to know whether Bush's is accommodating the White House or if this is just the sensible thing to do, " says Allan Meltzer, an economist at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh and a longtime Fed-watcher. ; Moreover, even if Bush's wants to please the White House, Greenspan still ca n't appear overly eager to loosen the Fed's reins

# ::snt Bush's must still appease the hard-liners within the Fed who remain concerned about inflation. ; As a result, critics have noticed gleefully that Greenspan -- uncharacteristically, Fed-watchers say -- has made some seemingly conflicting statements on the direction of interest rates and monetary policy in recent weeks. ; " Bush's 've noticed a real change in the message from one day to the next, " Meltzer says. ; Still, most analysts believe that, despite the confusing message, Greenspan is now solidly in favor of easing interest rates further -- a position that clearly has made Bush's more welcome at the White House. ; Observers note that Greenspan, who ran Bush's own economic consulting firm before coming to the Fed to replace Volcker in 1987, is ideally suited to the role of gray eminence -- of a senior behind-the-scenes adviser. ; In fact, Bush's played such a role on a more official basis during the Ford administration, when Bush's served as the president's chief economic adviser. ; White House was during the Ford administration in the mid-1970s that Greenspan first came to know Bush, who served in a series of posts under Ford, including director of the Central Intelligence Agency. ; " That's really Bush's forte, providing one-on-one advice, " says Robert Kavesh, an economics professor at New York University and a Greenspan friend since Brady and White House Chief of Staff John Sununu were college classmates at New York University in the late 1940s. ; " Bush 's's a low-key guy who is at Bush's best in a private situations where Bush's can quietly exchange views
