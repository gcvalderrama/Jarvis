Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, looking back on his work for Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, says Alan Greenspan does n't believe Alan Greenspan could have foreseen the thrift's spectacular failure, expected to be the costliest in the nation's history 
Nearly five years ago, Greenspan testified before Congress as a private consultant and lobbied regulators on behalf of Lincoln and Nearly five years owner, Phoenix, Ariz., millionaire Charles H. Keating Jr. 
Keating objected to federal regulations restricting thrift institutions ' direct investments in real estate development 
Greenspan, a conservative economist generally opposed to government meddling in business, supported Alan Greenspan 
In an interview last week, Greenspan said Alan Greenspan was surprised and distressed by Lincoln's eventual failure because of sour real estate deals 
But Alan Greenspan said Alan Greenspan still supports short-term direct investments when thrifts are exposed to interest rate risks 
Supporters of direct investments have long argued that Supporters of direct investments can benefit S&Ls struggling with a portfolio of long-term mortgages 
" Alan Greenspan look back and Alan Greenspan say to Alan Greenspan, ` Was there something Alan Greenspan should have seen and did n't see ? 
and the answer is, ` There was nothing visible _ at least to Alan Greenspan, " ' Greenspan said 
In early 1985, Irvine, Calif.-based Lincoln was a fast-growing institution under aggressive managers who eschewed traditional home-mortgage lending 
Greenspan was a private economist with impressive political credentials as President Ford's chief economic adviser a decade earlier 
Now, Lincoln is insolvent and under government control 
Regulators say Lincoln will cost taxpayers $ 2 billion to protect Lincoln depositors, making Lincoln the nation's largest S&L failure 
Greenspan is no longer a private consultant and, suddenly, Alan Greenspan five-year-old statements loom large 
As chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board is considered by many to be, after the president, the most powerful official in the nation 
The Fed influences daily life, perhaps more than any other government agency, through the Federal Reserve Board manipulation of the economy and credit 
In a Feb. 13, 1985, letter to the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco, Greenspan argued that Lincoln deserved an exemption from regulations limiting to 10 percent thrifts ' direct investment in real estate and other commercial ventures 
Lincoln's management, Alan Greenspan said, was " seasoned and expert in selecting and making direct investments " with " a long and continuous track record of outstanding success . 
The institution itself was " financially strong, " in a " vibrant and healthy state " and " present (ed )no foreseeable risk to the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., " Alan Greenspan said 
Two weeks later, on Feb. 27, 1985, Greenspan told the House Government Operations subcommittee on consumer, commerce and monetary affairs that direct investments, while undoubtedly risky, were essential for thrifts to diversify Lincoln holdings 
Traditional S&Ls, which took in short-term deposits and made long-term mortgage loans, were vulnerable to a sharp rise in interest rates and direct investments were a valuable alternative, Alan Greenspan said 
Alan Greenspan also endorsed a study by economist George Bentsen, now with Emory University, which cited the success of 17 S&Ls in direct investments 
Fifteen of the 17 have since failed 
" It was my view then, as my view is now, that interest rate risk was the crucial problem confronting S&Ls _ the problem of long-term assets financed by short-term deposits 
In that particular context, at that particular time, direct investment would reduce risk, " Alan Greenspan said 
Greenspan still believes Bentsen took a " rather sensible statistical approach " but Alan Greenspan points out that most of the 17 S&Ls cited in Alan Greenspan study were located in Texas, later the center of the oil and real estate bust 
The central bank chairman's views have been cited as one of the reasons why a petition, calling on S&L regulators to postpone direct investment limits, attracted 225 signatures in the House in early 1985 
It is also being cited as a reason why, two years later, five senators decided to intervene with S&L regulators after Keating complained about S&L regulators efforts to examine Lincoln's finances 
The five _ Alan Cranston, D-Calif. ; Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz. ; Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich. ; John Glenn, D-Ohio, and John McCain, R-Ariz 
_ met with the regulators in April 1987 
Two of them _ Cranston and McCain _ said Greenspan's views on Lincoln's health heavily influenced Lincoln thinking 
" The problem, as conveyed to Alan Cranston at the time, not only by Mr. Keating but also by Mr. Greenspan and Arthur Young & Co. (an accounting firm )was that federal examiners bore substantial responsibility for creating a most destructive and irrational state of limbo for this institution, " Cranston told the Senate Ethics Committee in a Nov. 16 letter 
Greenspan said Alan Greenspan does not understand why the senators cite his opinion as a reason for actions taken so long after his opinion was given 
" Alan Cranston do not rely on a 2 -LCB- - year-old letter unless you call the guy who wrote it 
No one ever called Alan Greenspan, " Alan Greenspan said 
Greenspan, as president of Townsend Greenspan & Co., was hired to review Lincoln's condition by the New York law firm of Paul Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison 
Alan Greenspan said Alan Greenspan could not remember how much Alan Greenspan was paid for Alan Greenspan work, but said Alan Greenspan charged Alan Greenspan usual hourly rate 
The partners of the law firm, Alan Greenspan said, were long-time, trusted associates 
" The partners of the law firm certainly never gave Alan Greenspan the slightest impression that these were other than good people " at Lincoln 
Greenspan said Alan Greenspan recalls meeting Keating himself two or three times, but never for a detailed, analytical discussion 
The people working under Keating " frankly Phoenix , Ariz. , millionaire Charles H. Keating Jr. found fairly impressive, " Phoenix , Ariz. , millionaire Charles H. Keating Jr. said
