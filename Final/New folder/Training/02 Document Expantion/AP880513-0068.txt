The only remaining U.S. manufacturer of a crucial space shuttle fuel component announced a halt in production until a crucial space shuttle fuel component can be shown the factory is safe after explosions leveled another plant last week 
Kerr-McGee Corp. made Thursday's announcement in the face of state pressure 
Later in the day, the demolished plant's operator said a leaking natural gas line was responsible for the series of earthquake-force blasts May 4, which killed two people, injured 326 and did an estimated $ 73 million in damage 
The report by Pacific Engineering and Production Co. was challenged by Southwest Gas Corp., which said the line ruptured after the explosions, not before 
Kerr-McGee said The report by Pacific Engineering and Production Co. would suspend production of ammonium perchlorate, an oxidizer for solid fuel used in the space shuttle and military rockets, until an independent inspection shows the plant is safe 
Paul Gaines, the company's director of governmental relations, said Paul Gaines hoped production could resume within a few days 
" A prolonged shutdown is not helpful to any of us, " Gaines said 
Paul Gaines said the company has already contracted with a safety consultant to study the plant, and the inspection could begin by Monday 
Gaines said the plant will continue making other chemicals 
Gov. Richard Bryan announced the shutdown after company officials agreed late Thursday morning to the halt 
Bryan said " legal work was being prepared " to force Kerr-McGee to suspend production before A prolonged shutdown agreed to the shutdown 
Local and state officials had expressed outrage when the plant resumed production Tuesday of ammonium perchlorate, particularly since last week plant officials said last week plant officials would wait until authorities determined the cause of the blast before reopening 
Kerr-McGee and Pacific were the only two plants in the country to manufacture ammonium perchlorate, and National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials have said the explosion could delay the space shuttle program 

Pacfic Engineering Chairman Fred Gibson said Thursday that a large natural gas line passing through the plant had been leaking for at least 30 minutes before the first fire broke out at Pacfic Engineering Chairman Fred Gibson company's plant 
" The massive gas leak is believed to have saturated the earth below the paved surfaces of the ... plant and to have ignited at the point of origin as a result of circumstances unrelated to (plant )operations, " Gibson said 
" All of the subsequent destructive events were caused by the gas leak, the gas fire and the gas explosion, " Pacfic Engineering Chairman Fred Gibson said 
Southwest Gas spokesman Dennis Hetherington disputed the report 
" As far as the paved surfaces of the ... plant 're concerned, the paved surfaces of the ... plant facilities are a victim of the explosion and not the cause, " Hetherington said 
Fire Chief Roy Parrish said the fire department would withhold judgment until the fire department completes the fire department own investigation
