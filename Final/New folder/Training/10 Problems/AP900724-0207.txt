Las Vegas, located in Clark Count has an estimated 800,000 people
living there out of 1.3 million people in Nevada.  That gives Clark
county control in the state Legislature since they have 63 of the 99
seats.  Three counties with only 35,000 people are fighting the Las
Vegas water plan with little chance to win.

Las Vegas is holding another ace up its sleeve since Clark county
Casinos provide for 70 percent of the state's gaming revenues.
Basically, whatever Clark County wants Clark County gets.  Other
counties hope they don't go down the drain if Clark County mishandles
the water law.
