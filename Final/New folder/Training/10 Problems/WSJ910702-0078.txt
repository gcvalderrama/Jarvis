Black conservative Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas was raised by
his grandfather with an ethic of hard work, personal dignity and
self-sufficiency. When he entered law school he was a black power
activist, but, he says, he never gave up his grandfather's ideals, and
when his left-wing opinions began to clash with those ideals, he moved
away from the left. He calls for finding solutions to our social
problems "through independence, perseverance and integrity."
"Basically the job of a judge is to figure out what the law says, not
what he wants it to say." An associate says, "he is a bright and
reflective man who believes passionately in fairness."
