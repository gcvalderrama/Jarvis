A nearly seven-year-long journey through Beirut's heart of darkness
ended Wednesday for Terry Anderson, the longest-held of the Western
hostages in Lebanon, bringing almost to a close a chapter of Middle
East history that brought successive U.S. administrations to
frustrated impotence before a shadowy group of radical Muslims.

Anderson arrived in Germany early today and was reunited with the
sister who campaigned tirelessly for his release.

At a press conference in Damascus, Syria, held Wednesday, the
44-year-old journalist said his companions sustained him in his long
ordeal in captivity, his religious faith and his "stubbornness."
