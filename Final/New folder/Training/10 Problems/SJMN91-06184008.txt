The expected reappointment of Alan Greenspan at Federal Reserve Board 
Chairman has not occurred.  His current appointment ends on August 11, creating a very 
tight schedule.  Bush and his advisers have often criticized the Fed but no acceptable 
candidate has surfaced.  Greenspan holds the confidence of the financial community and 
few economists blame the recession, underway since July 1990, on him. The 
announcement of the appointment could be delayed until after he testifies on the central 
bank's economic outlook for the rest of the year at the Humphrey-Hawkins hearing. If 
reappointed Greenspan would have another round of confirmation hearings before the 
Senate Banking Committee, but these also could be delayed.
