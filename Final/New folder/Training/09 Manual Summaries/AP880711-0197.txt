The American Medical Association and the Congressional Office of
Technology Assessment have said that polygraphs give a false report as
often as 50 percent of the time. A professor of psychology and
neurobiology is developing a lie detector that measures brain waves,
rather than bodily functions, as do the polygraphs now in use. He
claims that it will pick up 70 to 90 percent of those lying, and will
falsely accuse no one.  The developer also said that the new detector
will be on the market in four years, and it will cost ten times as
much as the polygraph machines now in use.
