Alan Greenspan, 64, has become a key economic advisor to President Bush, who 
has named him to lead a commission to study a proposal to cut the tax rate on capital 
gains. Greenspan has cut the Federal Reserve's key discount rate twice in the last 6 
weeks.  While these cuts are justified on economic grounds, they also agree with 
economic goals of the Bush administration. Greenspan must guide the Fed through the 
concurrent crises of the war, recession, bank failures, budget deficits, and crashing 
consumer confidence.  For the first 2 years the Bush administration was virtually at war 
with Greenspan, but Fed-watchers now expect him to be reappointed.
