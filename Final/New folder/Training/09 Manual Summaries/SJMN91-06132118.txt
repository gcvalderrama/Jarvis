Some policemen standing by during King's beating maintain the arrest
was done correctly, and the Grand Jury has decided against indicting
them for their inaction.  The Civil Liberties Union disagrees.  "I
couldn't be more disappointed," said spokesman Joe Hicks. "We have not
given up on this."

Meanwhile one rookie police officer was fired and three have been
suspended without pay by Chief Darryl Gates, who is investigating the
incident.  Only Gates has the power to discipline officers.

The District Attorney is forwarding the "disturbing interviews" with
bystanding officers to the local independent commission investigating
the police department.
