At a meeting in Vienna, General Colin Powell, Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, endorsed the East Bloc's move toward a more defensive
military posture and reassured his Warsaw Pact (WP) counterparts that
the US and its NATO allies will not launch an offensive military
operation against Eastern Europe.  However, he defended US military
initiatives that have introduced to Europe new, long-range weapons
designed to attack Soviet reinforcement forces for WP first-wave
attack.  There is intelligence information that the Soviets still have
large supplies of spare weapons parts and ammunition near the
East-West border available for an offensive operation.
