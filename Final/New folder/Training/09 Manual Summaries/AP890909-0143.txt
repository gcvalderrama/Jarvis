Exxon will pull out the last of workers cleaning-up oil from the Exxon
Valdez spill on Wednesday, because of deteriorating weather and
shortening daylight hours.  After treating over 1,000 miles of
shoreline, Exxon claims that only four miles remain untreated.
Government officials disagree.  Alaska is suing oil companies for
negligence in preventing and cleaning-up the spill.  On Saturday
fisherman demonstrated in Port Valdez.  Otter and bird rescue
operations are also shutting down.  More than 32,000 birds and 980
otters died.  The cleanup involved 12,000 workers and 1,300 vessels
and cost more than $1.2 billion.  Exxon has paid $90 million in damage
claims.
