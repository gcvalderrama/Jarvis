A California State Court of Appeals ruled on Monday that cities and
counties could require applicants for jobs as police officers to
submit to polygraph testing. In 1986 the State Supreme Court held that
any involuntary polygraph testing of state employees was
unconstitutional, but the court's ruling did not settle the issue as
regards public safety jobs. In the case at hand, a man who had taken
disability retirement sought reinstatement but was denied unless he
would submit to polygraph testing. He refused, saying that there were
less intrusive ways to screen applicants, but the court ruled that
public safety outweighed his argument.
