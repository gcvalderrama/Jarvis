On Sunday the moon partially passed between the Earth and sun bringing
a solar eclipse to India.  Hundreds of thousands of pilgrims bathed,
dressed and undressed, in the giant sacred pools at Kurukshetra.  Many
carried coconuts or gave alms to beggars and priests.  One 12-year-old
boy drowned.  Smaller numbers bathed at rivers and pools throughout
India.  The eclipse, which lasted about 90 minutes, was the third in
the past year.  The others occurred on March 18, 1988 and September
13, 1987.
