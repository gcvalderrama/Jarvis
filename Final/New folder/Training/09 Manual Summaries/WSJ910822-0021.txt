In a dramatic climax to the coup of Monday, August 19, in Moscow, the
hard-liners who took power were forced to capitulate yesterday by
protesters and a determined Russian Parliament led by Boris Yeltsin,
the president of Russia.  He seemed to tower over the hard-liners
during the standoff and now emerges easily as the most powerful man in
the nation.

Mikhail Gorbachev returned to Moscow last night from the Crimea where
he was under house arrest during the coup.  His future role in
bringing about stability is uncertain given public opinion that
Gorbachev himself created the possibilities for the coup.
