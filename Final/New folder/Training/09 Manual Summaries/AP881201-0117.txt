President Reagan will nominate National Security Advisor Colin Powell
for promotion to four-start rank and the post of Commander-in-Chief of
the Army's Forced Command.  This would make the 51-year old Powell the
fourth black officer to attain four-start rank in the US armed forces.
The new job includes preparing soldiers for worldwide deployment and
defending the US continent.  Powell is a graduate of City University
in New York and has an MBA from George Washington University in
Washington.  Wounded on both of his tours in Viet Nam, he holds the
Distinguished Service Medal, the Bronze Star, and the Purple
Heart.
