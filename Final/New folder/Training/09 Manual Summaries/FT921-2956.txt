Prieska is a desert farming community in northern South Africa's Cape
Province. It was the site of Friday's annual agricultural show.

South Africa's minister of agriculture is also a farmer. Kraii van
Niekerk was campaigning in his constituency. He was trying to convince
his fellow farmers to continue political reform and adopt his own
farming techniques because of the drought.

His platform is one of minimizing the number of farmers going bankrupt
by offering loans, writing off debt and obtaininig subsidies.

To permit a large number of farms to fail would result in
unemployment, thus exasperating the food problem.
