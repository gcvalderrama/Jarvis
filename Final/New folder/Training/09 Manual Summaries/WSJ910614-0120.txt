Boris Yeltsin won a comfortable victory in the Russian Republic's
first presidential election.  The vote underscored strong public
desire for change and the dwindling influence of the Soviet Communist
establishment.  The US administration has avoided doing anything to
add to Mr. Yeltsin's stature as a rival to Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev.  It now appears that a new working relationship between
Yeltsin and Gorbachev has changed the situation.  Putting aside strong
differences, they are working on transforming the Soviet Union at a
more rapid pace; namely, a new federal structure decentralizing much
political and economic power to the nation's 15 republics.
