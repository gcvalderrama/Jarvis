Terry Anderson marked the fifth year as a hostage today.  His sister,
Peggy Say, and other family members and friends wrote greetings to
Mr. Anderson that were published in English by the French-language
newspapers An-Nahar and As-Safir.

Police say Lebanese authorities have no information on the whereabouts
of Mr. Anderson and 15 other Western hostages in Lebanon.

Four day ago, Mr. Anderson's captors, the Islamic Jihad, made its
first statement in a year, offering to trade Anderson and another
hostage, Tom Sutherland, for their comrades jailed in Kuwait.

A copy of the statement was delivered to a western news agency in
Beirut and included a photograph of Anderson.
