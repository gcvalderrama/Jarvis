Deteriorating relations between Britain and China over Hong Kong's
political future has cast a pall over the colony's financial markets.
Governor Patten has proposed elections in 1994 and 1995 to allow for
greater democracy for the people and is supported by the people.
Patten has repeatedly indicated a go-it-alone possibility marking a
change in British policy toward Hong Kong and China, which had placed
priority on reaching agreement with Beijing.  China claims that
financing proposals from the Hong Kong government would put a heavy
financial burden on the post-1997 community.  China could sacrifice
the economic well-being of its people in response to a perceived
threat to its authority.
