Neil Bush came to Colorado to get rich in the oil business, but his
company, JNB Exploration, never found any oil and was sold in
1989. Bush made some money selling lease-hold interests and now heads
Apex Energy, an oil and gas exploration company.  His poise in the
spotlight led to suggestions of a political future for him, but now
angry at the attention he's receiving over his role in the collapse of
the Silverado S&L and at "government mismanagement" in selling off
troubled savings institutions. He and his wife Sharon and their three
children recently moved to a wealthier neighborhood for privacy.
