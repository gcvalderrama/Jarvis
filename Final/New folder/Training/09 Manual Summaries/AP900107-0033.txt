The District of Columbia had 438 murders in 1989 and over 1300
woundings. 70% of them were gun related. This despite the fact that
guns had been banned in the city ten years before.

A survey of the source of the guns seized in D.C. shows that 52%
originated in Virginia, 18% in Maryland and the remainder had
scattered origins.  An analysis showed that most are handguns, half
are semi-automatic weapons, and the majority were expensive weapons,
of law-enforcement quality or better.

Washington's location, abutting Maryland and Virginia, demonstrates
that a federal law is necessary.  The National Rifle Association
disagrees.
