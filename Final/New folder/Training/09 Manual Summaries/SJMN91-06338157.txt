President Bush's son George informed White House Chief of Staff John
Sununu last Wednesday that Sununu had alienated members of the
cabinet, the White House Staff and the Republican community. The
message was meant to be taken as a suggestion that Sununu offer to
resign. Instead, Sununu took the message as a call to rally his
support among members of congress and the conservative wing of the
Republican Party to convince the President that he should remain at
his post. Officials said that the president himself met with Sununu
Sunday. The outcome of that session was unclear.
