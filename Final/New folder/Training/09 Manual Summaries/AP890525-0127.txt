Two scientists say volcanic eruptions may have little effect on
climate cooling. The cold weather in 1816 has been blamed on a series
of eruptions worldwide between 1812 and 1815, but the periodic warming
and cooling effect of El Nino, which brought arctic air south, was
also involved. Only the largest eruptions effect a modest cooling for
one or two years. Volcanic dust clouds drastically reduce the solar
beam but also trap the earth's heat, unlike greenhouse gases which do
not block sunlight. Also, volcanic dust has a negligible effect
because it shades a small portion of the earth's surface.
