Messrs. Steger, American and Etienne, French enlisted four others from
the U.S.S.R, China, Japan and Great Britain for an unmechanized, 4000
mile, seven month attempt to cross Antarctica.  Planning to travel
thirty miles per day on cross-country skies with dogsleds, they wish
to draw international attention to threats against nature and the need
for cooperation in protecting Antarctica.  An international treaty
initiated in 1959 halted all territorial claims, banned military
activity there and established freedom of scientific inquiry.  But
many countries now covet the land for strategic, political and
economic reasons.  About 45 nations have signed television contracts
with the expedition.
