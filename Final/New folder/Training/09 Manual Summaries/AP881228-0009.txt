A law took effect yesterday that makes it illegal for most employers
to use the controversial polygraph for pre-employment screening, or
against workers already on the payroll. It is expected that the law
will ban 80 percent of the two million polygraphs administered
annually. The law will have its greatest impact in those states that
have no laws banning or restricting polygraph use. Firms providing
armored cars, security alarms and security guards are exempt, as are
companies that manufacture and dispense controlled substances. The law
does not apply to local, state and federal governments, and to firms
doing sensitive work for the government
