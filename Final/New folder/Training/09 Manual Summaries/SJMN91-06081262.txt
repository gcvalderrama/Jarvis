Bryant Allen, a passenger in Rodney King's car, says he was racially
provoked and made to crawl on the ground as he heard King being
beaten.  Fearing for his own life, he heard King scream, "stop," then
become silent as the sounds of the beating continued.  Another
passenger, Freddie Helms, agrees.  King and his friends are black.

The police officers were white and as many as 21 were present.  Four,
a sergeant and three officers, have been indicted for assault.

Allen, King's friend since childhood, said they had each consumed some
beer, but no drugs.  Tests confirmed this.
