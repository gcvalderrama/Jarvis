The U.S. ground war to liberate Kuwait is proceeding with surprising
speed and success.  Thousands of Iraqi prisoners have been taken in
the first hours of fighting leaving much equipment destroyed or
abandoned in Kuwait.  Officials are optimistic the war can begin to
wind down in a matter of days.  However, allied forces may still
suffer greater casualties.  Iraq has still not unleashed its stockpile
of chemical weapons.  Paradoxically, the perception that the
U.S. wants to destroy Iraq may increase Saddam's support within the
Iraqi military and the Arab world since we didn't back the peace
proposals brokered in Moscow.
