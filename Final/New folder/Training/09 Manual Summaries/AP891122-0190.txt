Botanist Linda Leigh will exit Thanksgiving afternoon from 21 days
inside an airtight, 17,000 cubic foot glass and steel structure, a
test module for Biosphere II, a $30 million project under
construction.  Eight people will be placed inside a much larger sealed
structure for two years to determine whether humans can duplicate
Earth's life systems for possible use in space.  She says the only
thing she misses is companionship, but she is otherwise content being
in frequent contact with the outside support team by telephone, video,
radio, and just looking through the glass window.  Daily medical
checks have shown her health is unbelievably positive.
