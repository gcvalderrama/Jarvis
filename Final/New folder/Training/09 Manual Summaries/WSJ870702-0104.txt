President Reagan named Judge Robert Bork, 60, as his replacement to
the Supreme Court for retiring Justice Powell.  Bork faces a tough
confirmation battle lead by liberal Senate Democrats.  Bork, a Yale
Law School Professor in the 60's was appointed solicitor general in
1973 by President Nixon and then to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia in 1982 by Reagan.  He earned a reputation as an
intellectual leader of conservative legal thought through his prolific
and forceful writings as a law professor and judge.  He believes
strongly in precedent and a narrow judicial interpretation of law.
