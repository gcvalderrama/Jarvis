Bill Clinton's friends came to his aid when charges of draft dodging
were raised.  A group from Oxford all testified of his anguish over
his draft status.

Later, when the draft and womanizing issues threatened, friends like
San Nunn and Zell Miller came to his rescue.

Mr. Clinton has cultivated friends all his life and always maintained
relationships through calls and notes.  Individuals from Georgetown,
Oxford, Yale and the Renaissance policy organization make up this
group.  They have helped him by raising money, managing campaigns and
defending him in crises.

Clinton knows how to make friends, and how to use them.
