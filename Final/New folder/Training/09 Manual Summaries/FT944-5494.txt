Hong Kong's passage from British Colony to a "special administrative
region" of China will be controversial.  The Chinese are beginning to
realize they need British cooperation and agreement has been reached
on funding for the airport development.  The biggest problem that Hong
Kong faces is the continuity of the civil service since the people are
still fearful of the Communist Party. Beijing has said it will dismiss
the Legislative Council when it assumes sovereignty and replace it
with a provisional legislature.  China's supporters in the colony
claim that Governor Patten's policy to repeal some of the more
repressive legislation will make it harder to govern.
