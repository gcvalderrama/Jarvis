Neil Bush says he's never traded on being the president's son, while
conceding in congressional testimony concerning his role in the failed
Silverado S&L that a risk-free $100,000 investment in the commodities
market on his behalf by Bush company investor Kenneth Good sounded a
little fishy.  He later helped Good receive a Silverado loan for an
Argentine project involving Bush's company.  Bush's friends call him
naive and unsophisticated. Bush was invited to join the Silverado
board at age 30 with no banking experience because of his name.  He
implies he was as ill prepared to be on the board as any of the
members.
