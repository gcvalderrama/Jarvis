Congressional Democrats are one signature short of the 12 votes needed
for a special prosecutor to examine the role of President Bush's son
Neil in the collapse of Silverado S&L after Rep. Feighan withdrew his
name. Neil says he never discussed S&L operations with his father, but
old presidential friend and banking lobbyist Thomas Ashley called the
president, who then requested Ashley to call Neil. Ashley denies he
was asked, says he is not trying to serve as a go-between for Neil and
the president, and says Neil made up his own mind to fight the case
and refuse to negotiate an out-of-court settlement.
