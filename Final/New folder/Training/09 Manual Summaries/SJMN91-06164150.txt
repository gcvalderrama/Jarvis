Survivors of the Mount Pinatubo eruption relocated to a refugee camp
near Olongapo, told a tale of panic and flight.  The eruption began
with a great gray-greenish mushroom cloud that turned day into night.
A rain of ash followed.  Refugees even used cardboard boxes in an
attempt to protect themselves from ash.

Clouds of volcanic ash drifted towards the South China Sea.

Seismologists warned that the crisis may not be over.  They believe
that the volcano has plenty of built-up magma and that more severe
eruptions could follow.  One news reporter likened the huge eruption
as being similar to a nuclear explosion.
