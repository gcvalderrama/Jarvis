Lt. General Colin Powell, the National Security Adviser, has been
suggested as a possible running mate for Vice President George Bush by
a newspaper column and some federal government officials.  Powell, on
at least two occasions, when reporters were questioning the President
and then the Secretary of Defense, made no comment about his
prospects.  The most recent thing Powell has said about his future was
in a speech on July 19 in Los Angeles.  He said he expected "to go
back to a nice quiet foxhole where I can serve my country in a more
comfortable and perhaps less exposed position."
