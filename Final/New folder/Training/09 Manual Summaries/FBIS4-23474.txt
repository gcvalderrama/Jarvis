Malawi has been added to the list of countries requiring the import of
food following crop failure in 1994-95.

Malawi needs the import of food for three million people.

Some of the imported food will be used in the market to stabilize
supply and prices. This would prevent riots, hoarding, and extreme
prices, all of which occurred during the 1992 famine.

Malawi has not yet recovered from the 1991-1992 drought. Malnutrition
rates are high, particularly among children.

Malawi is landlocked but it did not have any problems in the
distribution of imported food during the previous drought and
famine.
