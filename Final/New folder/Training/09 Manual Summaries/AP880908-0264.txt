After studying business at the University of California, Berkeley, and
the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, Michael Milken joined
Drexel Firestone & Co. in Philadelphia as a junior bond
trader. Mergers made the firm into today's Drexel Burnham Lambert. In
1977 Milken convinced Drexel to let him move the company's junk bond
operations from Wall Street to Beverly Hills, California. Working
12-13 hours a day seven days a week he has transformed Drexel Burnham
Lambert from a minor player on Wall Street into a powerhouse, and as
head of the firm's junk-bond operations has acquired a fortune
exceeding $500 million. Now Milken faces charges of insider trading.
