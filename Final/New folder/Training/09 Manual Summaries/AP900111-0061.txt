Cancer researchers speculate that genes that oversee the body's
production of interferon may play a role in warding off cancer
development. Researchers at the University of Chicago found an
association between the loss of these genes and development of acute
lymphoblastic leukemia, the most common childhood leukemia.  Some
genes, called oncogenes may trigger cancer.  Cancer may also occur
when other genes, known as anti-oncogenes are missing.  Production of
interferon is controlled by two genes (alpha and beta-1) that are
close together on chromosome 9.  Researchers found that this section
of the chromosome was frequently missing in those with lymphoblastic
leukemia.
