What will happen when the four-man and four-woman crew is locked in
the Biosphere II in the testing to duplicate the Earth's ecology?  How
are they going to react performing their tests and in getting along
with each other?  Exceedingly well, according to predictions.  They
are highly motivated and have more options than normally encountered
in classical isolation experiences.  They have the latest gadgets:
video teleconferencing, telephones, television, VCRs, and computers.
They will be able to get away and stargaze from their own environment.
Members can leave through airlocks if health or family emergencies
necessitate.  The biggest problem may be overwork.
