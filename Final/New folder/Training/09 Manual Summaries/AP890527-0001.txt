The Navy is preparing to discipline 15 members of the crew of the USS
Vincennes on drug abuse charges. None of the 15 was in a position to
influence the decision of Captain Rogers when he ordered the shootdown
of an Iranian airliner in July 1988. The Navy also announced that the
Vincennes would be sent to the Long Beach Naval Shipyard so
deficiencies in the Aegis Electronic Combat Control System could be
corrected. The Aegis was designed to make computer driven decisions
for an entire fleet, but its performance in the Persian Gulf did not
meet expectations.
