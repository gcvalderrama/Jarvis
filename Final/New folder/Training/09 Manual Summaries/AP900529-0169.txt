A natural gas well 75 miles SE of Jackson, Mississippi exploded at
about 2pm Tuesday, killing one worker and critically burning four
others. Authorities first evacuated people within a half-mile but
expanded to two miles for fear winds would scatter poisonous hydrogen
sulfide gas, which is naturally associated with some gas
fields. Officials intended to use a flame thrower to keep the escaping
gas burning in order to burn off the poison. Experts at capping gas
wells were to fly in Tuesday night. The gas rig, owned by R&H Oil and
Gas of Tickfaw, LA, was known as Travis No. 3.
