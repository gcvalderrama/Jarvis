Populist reformer Boris Yeltsin won the presidency of the largest
Soviet republic Tuesday, overcoming opposition by Mikhail Gorbachev
and declaring the start of "Russia's social, economic, and spiritual
rebirth."  Lawmakers said they believed Yeltsin gained the last few
votes he needed by offering to form a coalition government with the
Communist Party bloc and other groups.  Yeltsin said he believed he
gained several voters because of a last-minute push by Gorbachev to
block his election.  Gorbachev reportedly urged delegates at a meeting
Monday night not to vote for Yeltsin.  Yeltsin won 535 votes, four
more than the majority needed.
