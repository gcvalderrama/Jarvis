No decision has been made on the fate of Alan Greenspan, but administration 
officials say efforts to depose him will probably fail.  He is well regarded in financial 
markets and the Fed chief is considered a Wall Street call.  Although Bush's top 
economic advisers have complaints about Greenspan, they have no replacement they all 
could support.   Bush considers Greenspan a friend and adviser.   Greenspan has not 
made an impression on the general public and a majority (59%) has no opinion on his 
reappointment.  He has drawn high praise from academics, although his own academic 
work is obscure.  His 1977 dissertation cannot be found.
