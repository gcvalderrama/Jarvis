Hong Kong Governor Patten pressed China to accept his proposals for
the Colony's political development or make alternatives.  No meeting
of the minds emerged after long discussions between Patten and Lu
Ping, director of China's office of Hong Kong and Macao affairs.  The
impasse is over the financing of a new airport project, stalled in the
Airport Committee of the Anglo-Chinese Joint Liaison Group.  China's
Prime Minister, Li Peng has refused to meet with Patten, who has in
the past suggested that he would be prepared to propose a faster pace
of democratic development in Hong Kong without China's
approval.
