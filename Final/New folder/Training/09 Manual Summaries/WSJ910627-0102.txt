White House Chief of Staff Sununu may find some comfort in a new poll
showing that of the voters surveyed, 80% had heard of the latest
charges of inappropriate use of government and corporate
transportation, but of those only 58% think that he should resign. On
the other hand, the poll shows that 41% of voters now have a negative
view of him compared to just 20% last October. Sununu has adopted a
low profile apparently thinking that he can ride out the storm, but
some administration aides and Republican strategists argue that he
should be pushed aside before Bush's re-election campaign gets into
full swing.
