"We're in a race with a catastrophe," says Alan Pollock of the
National Transportation Safety Board on efforts to improve cruise ship
safety.  He said a cruise ship disaster would create overwhelming
pressure for new safety regulations, but he would rather take
preventive action.

Safety experts are primarily concerned with fire protection,
especially in the big new atrium ships, the ability of crewmembers to
give safety instructions in a language that passengers understand and
the aging of the world fleet of cruise ships.

Jim Bennett, chairman of the National Transportation and Safety Board
said, "The potential for loss of life is enormous."
