Charles Keating, of Lincoln Savings and Loan notoriety, was a
collegiate gold medal swimmer and a Navy fighter pilot during World
War II.

After the war, Keating began his career in Cincinnati, Ohio as a
lawyer.  During his early career, others sized him up as aggressive,
impatient, a risk taker and a stubborn competitor. All of these
characteristics were to mark his later career and prominence in the
U. S. savings and loan scandel beginning in 1985.

None of these early characteristics ascribed to Keating included the
words "dishonest" and "deceptive" and these were to mark his later
career as well.
