John Sununu submitted his resignation in a five-page handwritten
letter that made it clear he felt betrayed. He was simply doing what
he was hired to do and his dismissal was not a matter of principle but
of ratings. His bullying tactics were fine as long as the opinion
polls did not go down. While Sununu's lack of political skill in
dealing with Washington was a factor, and while his fatal flaw may
have been in believing he was smarter than Bush, what finally cost him
his job was opposition of the president's wife, Barbara, and his
oldest son, George.
