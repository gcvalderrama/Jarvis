Critics have long contended that the Biosphere II project in the
Arizona desert was more showmanship and cultism than science, despite
its assertions to the contrary.  Allegations of misrepresentation
involve a device that removes carbon dioxide from the air and turns it
into a solid for storage inside the Biosphere.  A newspaper states the
group secretly installed the device, violating the goal of recycling
all materials naturally.  A Biosphere spokesman said the group had
installed a carbon dioxide remover but called it a minor aid for
initial stabilization, adding there was no obligation to disclose all
details of work in progress.
