The code of ethics of the failed Silverado S&L where Neil Bush was a
director requires officials to avoid or report any situation that
appears to be a conflict of interest.  Bush is accused of ignoring
this by supporting further financing for big Silverado borrowers while
failing to inform colleagues that he had important business
connections with them. The Office of Thrift Supervision seeks a
cease-and-desist order barring Bush from future violation of conflict
of interest regulations and the FDIC names him in a $200 million suit
against Silverado directors. Bush supporters say he is an honest but
naive young man being persecuted because he is the President's son.
