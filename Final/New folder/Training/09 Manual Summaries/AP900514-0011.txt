"The number of tourist visiting Antarctica has more than tripled in
the past five years," said Bruce Manheim, a Washington activist with
the Environmental Defense Fund who calls existing controls to protect
Antarctic wildlife inadequate.  Manheim's appeal seeks strict controls
on helicopter flights near wildlife sites, guidelines on tourist
observation of wildlife, and coordination of cruise ship visits to
breeding grounds.  Because most tourists to Antarctica are Americans,
conservations believe the U.S. should take the lead in adopting a
model regulatory policy.  The U.S. government responds that effective
regulations are already in place.  The National Science Foundation
regulates U.S.  activities in Antarctica.
