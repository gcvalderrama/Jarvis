Clark Air Base, now closed, and the villages surrounding Mount
Pinatubo in the Philippines continue under the threat of a major
volcanic eruption.

Philippine counterparts are the only personnel near the mountain.
They are in a protected bunker and continue to monitor the volcano in
an attempt to provide early warning to anyone in the erupting
volcano's path.

If a massive eruption occurs, Pinatubo will explode with an avalanche
of ash 1000 degrees or higher and traveling at 100 miles per hour.  It
would engulf everything in its path.
