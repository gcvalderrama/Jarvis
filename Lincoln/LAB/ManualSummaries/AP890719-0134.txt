An undersea volcano erupted off the coast of Ito, Japan on July 13th,
creating a mound 82 feet high. Thousands of tremors and several
volcanic eruptions have occurred in the past two weeks and authorities
warn the volcano is likely to erupt again. Doctors report a growing
number of stress-related illnesses, including insomnia and
gastritis. People didn't feel sick for a couple of days after the
eruption because they were still tense. Pets, more sensitive and
feeling temblors and noises more strongly, developed similar symptoms
the very next day. Humans have information which helps to relieve
tensions but animals don't.
