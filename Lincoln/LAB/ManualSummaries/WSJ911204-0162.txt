During a flight to Florida on Air Force One, President Bush
effectively forced the resignation of his feisty chief of staff, John
Sununu.  Sununu's removal may not solve the president's immediate
political problems as it could exacerbate criticism from the
right. Sununu's strong anti-abortion stand won him strong support
among social conservatives who distrusted Mr. Bush's roots in the
moderate wing of his party. But Sununu's heavy-handed lobbying in
congress and seeming disregard for its members' stature as elected
representatives had bruised congressional egos and his abrasive
operating style which had alienated longtime Bush allies would be a
liability in the forthcoming re-election campaign.
