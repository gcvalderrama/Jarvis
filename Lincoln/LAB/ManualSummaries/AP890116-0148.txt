A natural gas explosion leveled a house Thursday, and explosions six
blocks away on Saturday leveled a second house and knocked a
neighboring one off its foundation, in a town 60 miles northwest of
Chicago. The sites were fed by two separate gas lines and Northern
Illinois Gas calls the explosions coincidences. Crews found nothing
unusual at 100 homes and a school within a mile radius of the
explosions. The blasts' causes may not be known for weeks. No serious
injuries resulted. In Thursday's explosion, a man's mattress carried
him to safety when it was sent flying into the driveway.
