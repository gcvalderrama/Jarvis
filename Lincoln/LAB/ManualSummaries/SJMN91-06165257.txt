Boris Yeltsin was elected president of the Russian republic by winning
up to 57 percent of the vote.  The victory was certain to accelerate
reforms across the Soviet Union and it cleared the way for him to
travel to Washington next week, at the invitation of Congress, in a
demonstration of independence from Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.
The White House applauded his election as a "good sign" for democracy
and said he would visit here next Thursday.  However, democracy is
still in its infancy in Russia.  Election officials say they are
laboriously counting paper ballots cast at each of 98,000 polling
stations.
