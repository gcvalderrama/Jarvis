President Bush offered to help Jordan's King Hussein offset costs
incurred to shut down Jordan's port at Aqaba, Iraq's last remaining
trade outlet.  The U.S. Navy now has 27 ships in the maritime blockade
of Iraq.  The U.N. economic chokehold appears to be working.

Saddam Hussein said the outbreak of war would cost thousands of
Americans lives.  Iraq has increased its armed forces in Kuwait to
160,000 and rimmed the capital city with an air-defense system.

It has been reported that Saddam was the target of an assassination
attempt, which led to many arrests, including some of his close
associates.
