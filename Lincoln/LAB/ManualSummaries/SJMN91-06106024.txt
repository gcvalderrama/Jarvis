Rodney King spends his time seeing doctors and thinking about his
injuries he fears may become permanent.  He is staying with relatives
and fears retribution by the police.  His ex-wife says he's depressed
and frightened; his attorney has hired guards to protect him.

King suffers headaches and numbness of the face after five hours of
plastic surgery to repair fractures of his cheek and eye bones, and
has instituted an $83 million law suit against the city for excessive
force.

In another development, he's now a suspect in a February 21 robbery
and shooting, a result of the wide publicity.
