Russians vote Wednesday in the first democratic elections for the
presidency of the Russian Republic and the mayors of various cities.
On Monday, some 30,000 people marched in support for the front runner
for president, Boris Yeltsin.  The campaign has turned dirty with
newspaper allegations that Yeltsin is emotionally unstable.  Yeltsin's
aides have charged that Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev personally
ordered a KBG smear.  This indicates that rapprochement between
Yeltsin and Gorbachev is only skin deep and also indicates growing
desperation by Soviet leaders.  Failure to win an absolute majority
will force a runoff with Yeltsin's main opponent, former Soviet Prime
Minister Nikolaj Ryzhkov.
