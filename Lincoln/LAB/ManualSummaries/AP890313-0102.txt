On March 16, 1989, Terry Anderson entered his fifth year of captivity
as a hostage in Lebanon, according to Anne Nelson, executive director
of the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists.  Ms. Nelson
read her statement at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C.,
where Vice President Dan Quayle was scheduled to make a speech.

"We call on President Bush and Vice President Quayle to use every
possible means to bring Terry Anderson and the other hostages home,"
Ms. Nelson said.

The International Federation of Journalists said it would place
advertisements in Beirut newspapers to urge the release of all
hostages.
