The Senate overwhelmingly approved the appointment of economist Alan 
Greenspan to become chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, a position called the 
second most powerful in the country.  Only two senators, Conrad of North Dakota and 
Bradley of New Jersey--both Democrats, voted against the appointment.  Greenspan, 
who headed the Council of Economic Advisers under President Ford, has considerable 
knowledge and experience.  He has developed a reputation as an inflation-fighter.  He is 
in a position to influence monetary policy and affect the economy's performance over the 
next four years.
