A study of 248,046 US veterans showed that heavy smokers (more than 21
cigarettes a day) had a 93% greater chance of developing fatal
leukemia than those who never smoked.  For smoking between 10 and 20
cigarettes a day the increased risk was 75%, and 31% for fewer than
ten cigarettes a day.  The latest analysis doesn't prove a causal
link, but an editorial in a British Medical Journal said that if the
link is causal, "then smoking is a more important cause of leukemia
than all other known causes combined."  Leukemia is the third leading
cause of death among US children and fifth overall in cancer
deaths.
