Michael Milken, 42, has resigned after 19 years with Drexel Burnham
Lambert.  Milken who reportedly made $550 million in 1987 faces $1.85
billion in forfeitures if convicted on a 98-count fraud and
racketeering indictment.  Milken's trial is set for next March (1990)
in federal court in Manhattan.  Milken is forming a consulting firm,
International Capital Assets Group, to assist companies that want to
raise money. Milken's resignation ends the relationship between one of
the most important financial players of the decade and the firm he
helped boost from a second-tier brokerage to the nation's fifth
largest.
