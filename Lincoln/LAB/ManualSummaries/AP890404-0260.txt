Tuesday, the Exxon Valdez crew finished pumping the remaining crude
oil out of the tanker and will attempt to pump air into the hold and
refloat the vessel at high tide Wednesday afternoon.  The tanker will
be moved to a remote cove for emergency repairs.  Exxon is looking for
a dry dock for the final repairs.  Thick oil now covers more than
1,640 square miles of water and 800 miles of beach.  The annual
herring season has been cancelled and the sablefish and shrimp
fisheries closed.  Efforts are underway to protect the salmon
hatchery.  The captain, Joseph Hazelwood, is in New York and
reportedly ready to surrender.
