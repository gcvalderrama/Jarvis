Mike Dukakis' effort to tighten government controls on handguns
provided ammunition for Rep. George Bush and the NRA in the 1988
presidential election against Dukakis.  Although Dukakis supported the
Brady Bill, a 7-day wait for gun purchases, and a ban on Saturday
Night Specials, he said he is not against guns for sports and
protection.

Bush, as a presidential candidate and a lifetime member of the NRA,
opposed new federal gun controls, although he voted for federal laws
in 1968 as a congressman.

Dukakis says 22,000 Americans are killed yearly by handguns; Bush
says..."I have a deep appreciation for Second Amendment rights."
