Clarence Thomas, black conservative nominated to replace Justice
Thurgood Marshall, went before the Senate Judiciary Committee today
with the committee sharply divided as to whether or not the nominee
should be quizzed on his views on specific issues which might affect
decisions. Democrats Biden, Kohl, Kennedy, Leahy, and Metzenbaum
indicated that they would probe for Thomas's thinking on natural law,
abortion, privacy, civil rights, affirmative action, his attitude
towards Congress and other subjects. Republicans Thurmond and Hatch
warned of asking inappropriate questions while President Bush asked
lawmakers to "preserve the independence of the court" by avoiding
asking the nominee how he would vote.
