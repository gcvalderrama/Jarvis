Michael Milken's crimes were massive: systematically robbing clients
by trading on their confidential information, manipulating securities
prices to force deals on which he could make huge fees, gouging
unsuspecting clients on junk-bond issues, and taking for himself
securities meant for his customers. By 1982 Milken was making $45
million a year.  He soon enlisted Ivan F. Boesky in his
schemes. Boesky was already trading illegally on secret
information. The partnership flourished until Sept. 17, 1986 when
Boesky became an undercover agent for the Department of Justice.  This
was the beginning of the fall which culminated on Nov. 21, 1990 when
Milken was sentenced to 10 years in prison.
