A variation of an acne drug may be a potential treatment for adult
leukemia according to researchers at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center.  In this type of leukemia, white blood cells turn malignant at
an immature stage of development.  The acne drug may trigger these
cells to divide and mature and then die a natural death.  The drug is
known as tretinoin and is in a class of chemicals called retinoic acid
and is related to vitamin A.  The form of leukemia that appears to
respond is acute promyelocytic leukemia.  Patients with this type of
leukemia have a piece of chromosome 17 that has reattached to
chromosome 15.
