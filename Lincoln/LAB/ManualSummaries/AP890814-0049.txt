A total lunar eclipse visible from five continents will occur
Wednesday, beginning at 8:23pm EDT and ending 5 hours later.  The
eastern United States will get the best viewing, but it also will be
visible to observers in South America, western Europe, Africa and the
Antarctic.  A lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes through the
shadow created by the Earth, blocking the suni's light.  The last
total lunar eclipse visible over most of North America occurred in
December 1982, the next one will be in December 1992.  Total eclipse,
when the entire moon is covered by the central part of the shadow,
will begin at about 10:20 pm and last one hour and 36 minutes.
