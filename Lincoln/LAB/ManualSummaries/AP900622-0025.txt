The earthquake that hit Northern Iran on Thursday was similar to the
one that struck Armenia last December. Thursday's quake measured 7.7
on the Richter Scale; the one in Armenia measured 6.9. Shoddily
construction was cited as the major factor in the 25,000 deaths in
Armenia. Most of the victims in Thursday's quake also lived in fragile
homes, and the death toll could surpass the Armenian disaster because
the people were inside and asleep. Iran is a very active seismic
area. Twelve quakes of a magnitude greater than seven have hit Iran in
the last 30 years.
