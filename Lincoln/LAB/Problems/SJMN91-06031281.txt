The Bush Administration has submitted arguments to justify war with
Iraq to the United Nations.  Bush critics argued against war.

The failure of political initiatives since the August invasion of
Kuwait has culminated in a Congressional vote to approve U.S. military
force.  Should war start, allied bombing raids may disrupt Iraqi
communications, disable rocket launchers, anti-aircraft artillery and
chemical and nuclear sites.  Then troops will smash Iraqi tanks and
ground forces.  Over one million Iraqi troops face a vast array of
international troops and weaponry.  A short war should not engender
long-term international economic disruption.  A long war might.
