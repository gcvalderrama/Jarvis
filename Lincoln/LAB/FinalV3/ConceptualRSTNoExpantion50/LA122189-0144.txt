study  simple only measure  change  thing 
 research country  find  unambiguous thing  possible 
and  Rymer  Brown  also begin  monitor   Etna  microgravity 
small change  precede  volcanic eruption  certain type volcano 
 Eggers  find  actual decrease   Guatemala  volcano   Pacayo 
 research  report  increase  poas volcano   Rica 
 Eggers  say  and   Rymer   Brown  represent 
molten rock  cause  gravity 
we  possible see  progress  time long period 
 go  water level  water geyser 
lake  fill  normal depth 
 research  know  happen 
he  say  and  sensitive  get 
change small fraction  slight change  elevation 
accelerometer  get  calibration 
 use  predict  measurement  gravity 
land level measurement accurate site  accompany  measurement  gravity
