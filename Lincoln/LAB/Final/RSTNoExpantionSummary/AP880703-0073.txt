The USS Vincennesdestruction of an Iranian jetliner with 290 people aboard was a tragic result of its captain and crew 
On the basis of what we can find out on news reports , the captain acted the best way 
The association is made up mostly of men 
The current USS Vincennes is the fourth naval vessel 
The other thing , in my opinon , this is the other side of the Stark incident , Brooks said , 
the Iran Air jet shot down was a commercial Airbus carrying 290 people from the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas to Dubai 
all aboard were presumed dead
