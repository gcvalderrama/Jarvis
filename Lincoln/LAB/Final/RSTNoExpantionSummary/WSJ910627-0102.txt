WASHINGTON 
-- Embattled White House Chief of Staff John Sununu , fighting for his political survival , has a rare bit of good news : 
he should resign 
In a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll , voters were asked whether charges of inappropriate use of government and corporate transportation by Mr. Sununu are so serious 
that he should resign 
More than 80 % of the voters 
the assertions are not serious enough 
for him to resign 
he should quit 
The remainder either did not have an opinion or refused 
to answer 
That hardly means Mr. Sununu is out of the woods , of course
