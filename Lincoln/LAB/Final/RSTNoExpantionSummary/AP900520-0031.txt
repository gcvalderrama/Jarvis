A major earthquake rumbled through the jungles of southern Sudan on Sunday near the war-torn region's largest city , 
there appeared to be no casualties and little damage 
The quake measured 7.5 on the Richter scale 
but officials said 
A temblor of that size is capable 
the earthquake caused no deaths or injuries 
But much of the area 
that any news might take days or weeks 
Juba , southern Sudan's largest city , is 60 miles southwest of the quake's reported epicenter 
The official Sudan News Agency said 
of causing widespread destruction 
affected by the quake is so isolated 
The region has been hit by famine as well as fighting between the government and the rebel People's Liberation Army , and Juba is crammed with refugees from the 7-year-old civil war
