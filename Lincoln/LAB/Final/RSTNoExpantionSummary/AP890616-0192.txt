Michael Milken , the fallen Drexel Burnham Lambert financier , is striking out on his own 
But what is not clear is whether loyal ex-colleagues will follow the Pied Piper of junk bonds to his new firm _ 
and how long the venture will last with Milken 
Milken , 42 , resigned 
Thursday 
But Milken still commands tremendous loyalty among some key junk bond employees and Drexel clients , 
and no one is ruling out defections 
Milken associates did not release details on his plans , 
the Wall Street giant does not anticipate conflicts with Milken's new firm 
Under Drexel's still-to-be-approved settlement of civil insider trading and other fraud charges with the Securities and Exchange Commission , Drexel and its employees are barred from doing business
