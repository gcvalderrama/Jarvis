A partial solar eclipse visible across western North America bored scientists 
but thrilled crowds 
despite clouds covering parts of the region 
that were able to see it 
It is fabulous to know this is actually taking place 
Edie Lurie , an employee at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena , 
It is very fascinating , said 
where dozens used solar telescopes 
As the moon passed between the Earth and sun 
Also visible were gas jets on the sun's surface and a giant group of sunspots 
produced major solar flares _ eruptions of heat and radiation 
_
