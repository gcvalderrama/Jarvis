Fire long ago destroyed the house 
But nearby , down a woodsy , one-lane , white-sand road outside Savannah , Ga. , sits a reminder of what might have been -- the tired cottage 
where Clarence Thomas spent his boyhood 
where his sister 
still lives , by a broad , shining marsh 
called Moon River. ; Down shore sits the defunct packing factory 
where his family and most of the rest of the people in the semirural cluster of houses and trailer-homes 
known as Pin Point 
used 
and chop the heads off shrimp 
There , in the segregated black Georgia of four decades past , began the toughening of Clarence Thomas , nominee to the United States Supreme Court. ;
