what will happen 
How , indeed , are eight biospherians 
, 
So , you say 
when they lock four men and four women inside this fancy fish bowl for two years and watch 'em grow alfalfa sprouts and rice ? 
going to fare 
testing the completely sealed compound with five adjacent but contrasting environments , called biomes , as well as an intensive agricultural complex , 
to duplicate the Earth's ecology ? 
How are they going to react in shepherding 3,800 species of plants and animals 
And 
in getting along with each other ? 
Exceedingly well , 
according to predictions 
that will provide food and air
