the sun's light switch and total darkness over Hawaii signaled the beginning of the The Eclipse of the Millennium

after another at a mountaintop observatory atop Mauna Kea as the sky went blank 
That is the best eclipse

That is truly spectacular , said 
that only a blazing ring was visible in the western Americas
