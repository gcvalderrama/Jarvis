Putting John Sununu and Ted Kennedy 
Mr. Sununu , President Bush's chief of staff , is a combative , conservative Republican with a history 
Yet Mr. Sununu has just finished going head to head with the Massachusetts senator 
Mr. Sununu was typically tough ; at one point , he tracked down Sen. Kennedy on a boat for a blunt phone conversation to break a logjam in Senate-White House talks 
Adds Mr. Reilly : 
Contrary 
This was particularly evident during the Tower debacle , 
to work on a problem is like putting two scorpions in a bottle 
Despite such deft internal maneuvering , though , some Democrats and Republicans alike suspect Mr. Sununu , with his combative style , still may be accumulating too many enemies for his own good
