Japanese workers at U.S. Navy bases are protesting a policy 
Misao Kamiyama , chairman of the All Japanese Garrison Forces Labor Union , 
The plan neglects our basic human rights , said 
that requires workers 
which represents 1,200 workers at the U.S. bases 
The union asked the Defense Facilities Administration Agency , 
to urge the U.S. 
to drop the polygraph requirement 
who deal with confidential matters 
which hires Japanese workers for the bases , 
We are planning a full-scale nationwide protest against the decision 
to submit to lie-detector tests 
In Japan , only criminals get that kind of treatment , Mr. Kamiyama said
