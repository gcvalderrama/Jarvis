An experimental cancer drug 
according to a study 
that works after a single round of treatment appears to be the most effective medicine yet for a rare form of leukemia , 
The drug _ called 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine , or 2-CdA _ has produced complete remissions in almost all hairy cell leukemia patients treated , 
and none has relapsed so far 
Researchers 
who developed and tested the medicine report 
that it may well be the drug of choice in the treatment of hairy cell leukemia 
The drug also has been used successfully against chronic lymphocytic leukemia 
It , like hairy cell leukemia , is a cancer of the white blood cells ,
