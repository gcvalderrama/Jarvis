WASHINGTON 
-- White House Chief of Staff John Sununu has used five different corporate jets 
he will continue 
Mr. Sununu's use of a government limousine for a trip to a stamp auction in New York last week had created an appearance problem 
But Mr. Bush , in his most extensive comments so far on Mr. Sununu's controversial travel practices , also strongly defended his chief of staff 
to travel to Republican fund-raisers in the past six weeks , and the White House said 
to use such jets rather than government planes 
Meanwhile , President Bush said 
for political travel 
his job was safe
