Beginning in December , most private employers will be barred by law from using polygraphs 
and other types of lie detectors to screen job applicants or test the current employees except in rare circumstances 
Under new regulations issued Friday by the Labor Department , employers can be fined up 
to $ 10,000 
for requiring a job seeker or employee already on their payrolls 
The regulations , 
to submit to a polygraph exam for voice stress analysis 
which take effect Dec. 27 , implement legislation 
passed by Congress and signed by President Reagan last June 
outlawing about 85 percent of the current use of lie detector tests
