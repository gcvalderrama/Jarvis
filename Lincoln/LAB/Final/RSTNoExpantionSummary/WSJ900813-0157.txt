WASHINGTON 
-- Iraq's Saddam Hussein , his options 
for ending the Persian Gulf crisis 
The Iraqi leader , in an initiative 
growing increasingly unpleasant , assumed the role of embattled Arab hero in offering his first rough proposal for a negotiated end to the confrontation 
designed as much 
to rally Arab public opinion 
as to launch meaningful negotiations , announced 
yesterday 
that he will withdraw his troops from Kuwait 
only if Israel withdraws from the West Bank and Syria from Lebanon 
He apparently hopes to lure support from Arabs 
who have spurned him so far 
that Iraq will use its occupation of Kuwait as a lever
