FOR 16 years in Congress , I have been a 100 percenter in eyes of the National Rifle Association leadership 
For the past two decades , the entire Oregon House delegation , regardless of party , has voted with the NRA right down the line 
For a long time , it seemed like the right thing 
It does not any more 
But out West , politicians are still expected 
The conventional wisdom still is : 
I will vote for the Brady Bill 
The NRA has a strong presence 
to support NRA leadership 
that those days are over 
If you cross the gun lobby , they will have a silver bullet
