A volcano will erupt next month on the fabled Strip : 
a 60-foot mountain spewing smoke and flame every five minutes 
The man-made inferno will tower over a man-made lagoon with more than four acres of pools , grottoes and waterfalls 
Visitors , whisked from the Strip on a moving walkway , will glide over a habitat for rare white tigers , 
which will star in performances by the famed illusionist team of Siegfried & Roy 
Nearby , six dolphins will frolic in a 1.5 million-gallon saltwater aquarium 
At the core of all this stands a hotel 
In the lobby behind its nine-story , orchid-strewn atrium , a 20,000-gallon aquarium will come alive with sharks , stingrays , angelfish , puffers and other creatures of the deep
