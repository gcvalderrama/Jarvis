After all the lobbying , hand-wringing and Ronald Reagan's endorsement of the Brady gun-control bill , a ditty says 
it all : 
Cow kicked Nellie in the barn Did not do her any good , did not do her any harm 
Gun-control laws can never substitute for the hard work of apprehending and convicting criminals 
Still , the Brady bill is a small price 
to pay 
if Congress also agrees to the administration's crime bill 
that this gun bill would have a measurable effect on violent crime , or even that it would have stopped John Hinkley 
No one believes 
from buying the gun
