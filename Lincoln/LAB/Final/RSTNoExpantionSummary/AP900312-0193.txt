In the two years 
From his base at a conservative think 
tank he has become a best-selling author 
Robert Heron Bork does not dwell on past disappointments 
In fact , he sees himself 
having a bigger impact on the law from the sidelines 
he is taking his case to a higher court , the American public and the next generation 
One reason 
former Yale professor of law , former solicitor general , former professor at Yale again , former judge of the U.S. Circuit of Appeals , is now a best-selling writer 
that vindicated his views ? 
I never felt 
than he would have had from the bench
