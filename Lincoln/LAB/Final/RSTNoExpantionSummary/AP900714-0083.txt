To hear Neil Bush tell it , he is just a Denver guy 
Neil Bush , 35 , slim , tanned , blond father of three children , epitomizes the young , enterprising businessmen 
to get rich in the oil business 
trying to make a living 
and raise a family , 
and he is bewildered and angry at the attention he is receiving 
who came to Colorado in the early 1980s 
We lived month to month , begged for money from time 
that time in his life 
Like his father , Bush speaks in deliberate , run-on sentences , tipping his head during delivery , jabbing his finger occasionally , laughing an engaging , hiccuppy sort of laugh , displaying near-perfect teeth
