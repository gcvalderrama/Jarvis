The news from Iraq is bad 
After the brilliant military victory , a colossal human tragedy is emerging that is bringing the U.S. 
to the edge of a political defeat 
For it is the human dimension , we all know , 
that shapes the verdict of history 
The dynamics of the situation will soon force a change 
But do not despair ; the great victory in the Gulf war 
Within days , the United Nations will be compelled 
If the U.N. fails , it will become irrelevant 
as the League of Nations did in the 1930s 
As day follows night , the U.N. will thus move into ever expanding confrontations and conflicts with Saddam Hussein and his remaining military forces
