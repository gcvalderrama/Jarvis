President Quett Masire of Botswana said 
Thursday 
that industrial nations can help relieve drought and hunger in Africa by reducing global warming 
Masire and Dr. Bernard Ledea Ouedraogo , an anti-hunger organizer in Burkina Faso , were honored as co-winners of the 1988 Africa Prize for Leadership for their efforts 
caused by the greenhouse effect 
in averting hunger 
A severe drought gripped much of Africa from 1981 to 1987 , killing millions 
that due to the organizing efforts of Masire's government , not one person died of drought-induced famine in Botswana 
Experts believe 
Through early planning , Botswana organized a nutritional surveillance and warning system and distributed food nationwide
