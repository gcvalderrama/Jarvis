British researchers have found the first unambiguous evidence 
As a result , most studies have measured microgravity changes only at long intervals , often simply before and after a volcanic eruption , and the results have been open to various interpretations 
that small changes in gravity can precede a volcanic eruption 
In an article published today in the journal Nature the researchers report 
geologist 
The Rymer and Brown study , in 
so that the results are much clearer , said 
that gravity increased at the Poas volcano in Costa Rica over a two-year period
