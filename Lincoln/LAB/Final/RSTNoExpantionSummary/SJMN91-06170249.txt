BEBY TOLENTINO said 
Monday 
that she had crossed herself and frantically brought her hands 
together in prayer 
as the mudslide began to carry away the neighborhood church. ; 
that maybe God was trying to punish us , said 
Tolentino , her hands 
and face coated with the talc-like volcanic ash 
People think 
that has saturated the air 
it was not God 
Her neighborhood was leveled 
The Tolentinos and 100 other poor families along the Albacan River in Angeles , a once-bustling city of 280,000 people in the shadow of Mount Pinatubo , lost their homes 
I hope 
since Mount Pinatubo began erupting last week
