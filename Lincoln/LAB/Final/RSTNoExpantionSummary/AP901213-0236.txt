Columbia Savings & Loan Association has filed a $ 6 billion civil lawsuit 
accusing Michael Milken and other former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. officials of fraudulently peddling junk bonds in the 1980s 
that Milken and others manipulated 
and coerced Columbia and other thrifts into buying billions 
The lawsuit , filed Wednesday by the failing savings and loan , claims 
of dollars worth of the risky high-yield bonds 
Absent such deceit and manipulations it would have been clear that the market for junk bonds was highly illiquid and that junk bonds were unsuitable investments for savings and loan institutions , the suit says
