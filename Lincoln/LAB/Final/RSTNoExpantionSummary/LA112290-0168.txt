Despite what you may be reading , Michael Milken is not a bloodless monster 
who set out 
He is a very smart , very driven and very flawed 
Anyone 
Milken is not a symbol of the 1980s , whatever 
He is just a guy 
The idea 
was that the rewards 
that junk bonds 
to pillage the world 
and drown it in a sea of debt 
Milken took it too far by insisting 
human 
who does not feel at least a tinge of compassion for the man does not have an ounce of compassion in his body 
that means 
who was in the right place at the right time
