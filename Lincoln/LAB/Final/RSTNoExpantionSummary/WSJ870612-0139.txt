The Reagan administration may be willing to relax its opposition to an increase in the minimum wage 
in an interview 
for youths 
if Congress agrees 
to dilute the legislation significantly , Labor Secretary William Brock indicated 
Mr. Brock said 
that exemptions from the minimum wage would be necessary 
who lack entry-level job skills and for small businesses 
that Congress would have to drop plans 
to tie future rises in the minimum wage to the average wage for all non-supervisory private workers after 1990 
But the administration will remain opposed to any broad minimum-wage boost 
This is the first indication 
we can sit down
