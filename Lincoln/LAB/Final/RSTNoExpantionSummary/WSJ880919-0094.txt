Prospects for enactment of the first minimum-wage increase in eight years have improved sharply in recent days , sparked by Vice President George Bush's call for a boost in the wage floor 
Wage-increase bills were languishing on Capitol Hill only two weeks ago , with many members of Congress reluctant 
to support a wage rise in the face of heavy small-business lobbying and arguments 
that the increase would mean job losses 
Also , proponents of the bills feared the measure would be watered down too much 
But the tide began to turn 
when Mr. Bush , the Republican presidential candidate , voiced his support for a higher minimum wage soon
