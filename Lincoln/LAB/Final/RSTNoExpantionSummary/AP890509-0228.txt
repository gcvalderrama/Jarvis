On the untouched expanse of the Arctic icecap 
Will Steger , leading the first unsupported dogsled trek to the North Pole since Adm. Robert Peary's , saw the unmistakable evidence of cross-country skis 
it seemed a mirage _ preposterous , incredible : 
ski tracks 
they could only be those of Jean-Louis Etienne , a Frenchman 
He knew 
who was about to become the first man 
It was in April 1986 , in a tent on the monotonous frozen landscape , 
to ski alone to the pole 
that the two adventurers sipped tea 
and dreamed of their next quest : 
a multinational trek across Antarctica
