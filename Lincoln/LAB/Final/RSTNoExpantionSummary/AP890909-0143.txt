Thousands of oil-spattered workers hampered by worsening weather have only a few more days 
Exxon 
it will pull out the last of its workers by this coming Friday 
to clean crude oil off Alaska's petroleum-fouled shoreline 
before Exxon Corp. stops work 
for the season 
says 
after treating more than 1,000 miles 
of shoreline 
The company claimed 
Thursday 
but state and federal agencies disagree with Exxon 
tainted by the nation's worst oil spill 
that only four miles 
remained 
about how much has been cleaned and how well 
Our position is that the weather is going to make us go regardless
