Will Steger , five other men and 36 dogs crossed Antarctica in 1989-90 
They advertised their derring-do 
as a showcase for sponsorsequipment , a demonstration of international cooperation , an educational enterprise and a way 
of drawing attention to Antarctica and its environmental problems 
Before all those goals , however , came making it 
it was surely the cooperative cleaving to that central purpose 
And 
that brought him and his companions through in the face of considerable suffering and discouragement 
The Trans-Antarctica Expedition Mr. Steger writes about in Crossing Antarctica (Knopf , 304 pages , $ 25 )was 
born of the ambitions of Mr. Steger and Jean-Louis Etienne ,
