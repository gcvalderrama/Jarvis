Judge Robert Bork is the most qualified American alive 
to serve on the Supreme Court 
Liberal or conservative ? 
Or does he apply legal principles neutrally , 
The critics chased themselves into the corner of results-based evaluation of prospective judges by drawing the logical conclusion of judicial activism 
without regard to the parties ? 
Not since the great Holmes and Frankfurter have we had a jurist with such impeccable credentials 
Law is just politics , judges just politicians in robes 
As the Justice Department says , 
they view courts as simply another political 
The campaign against Judge Bork is shrill , mean and anti-intellectualan assault on the notion of law itself
