The election of Boris Yeltsin to the presidency of the Russian republic is a stunning personal defeat for Mikhail Gorbachev 
For more than two years , Mr. Gorbachev has used the propaganda mills of the Communist Party to discredit his former Politburo colleague 
Mr. Yeltsin's victory gives further impetus to the social and political forces 
that are tearing apart the last great empire 
From the platform of the Russian presidency , Mr. Yeltsin is certain 
to strike a triple blow against Mr. Gorbachev's political line 
He will challenge the Soviet president on the question of economic reform 
Mr. Yeltsin will also oppose the policy of imperial centralism
