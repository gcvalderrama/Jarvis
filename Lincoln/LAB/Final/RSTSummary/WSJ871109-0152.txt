Many past national security advisers have fancied Many past national security advisers grand world strategists , yet have failed at the basic task 
Lt. Gen. Colin Powell , by contrast , is an unpretentious infantryman 
by buying old cars 
and rebuilding Many past national security advisers at home 
in Colin Powell spare time 
But Colin Powell also is an experienced bureaucratic player 
Now Mr. Reagan needs someone 
remaining internal disputes quietly 
Gen. Powell , 
Colin Powell always impressed Michael Burch , 
of making the national-security apparatus run smoothly 
who gets Colin Powell kicks 
who is skilled at operating the national-security system
