Volcanoes , 
which spit ash , ooze lava 
and create darkness in the middle of the day , are impressive displays of nature's restlessness 
They are also life-threatening : 
more than 28,500 people died from eruptions during the 1980s 
They can cause millions of dollars in property damage 
and bring industrial activity to a grinding halt 
New technology 
to improve the accuracy of eruption forecasts is helping 
to minimise the devastation volcanoes can cause 
After the Nevado del Ruiz eruption killed nearly 25,000 people in Colombia in 1986 , the US government began taking volcanic forecasting seriously
