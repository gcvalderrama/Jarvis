Putting John Sununu and Ted Kennedy 
Mr. Sununu , President Bush's chief of staff , is a combative , conservative Republican with a history 
Yet Mr. Sununu has just finished going head to head with the Massachusetts senator 
and succeeding in negotiating an agreement on landmark legislation giving sweeping new rights to disabled Americans 
Mr. Sununu was typically tough ; at one point , the relentlessly self-confident Mr. Sununu tracked down Sen. Kennedy on a boat for a blunt phone conversation to break a logjam in Senate-White House talks 
to work on a problem is like putting two scorpions in a bottle
