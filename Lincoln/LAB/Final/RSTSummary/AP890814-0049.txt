A total lunar eclipse visible from five continents occurs after sunset Wednesday 
when the full moon orbits into the shadow of the Earth and slowly turns from a bright silver into a copper or orange disk 
More than a billion people will have a chance 
to watch as the moon appears 
The celestial show starts at 8:23 p.m. EDT over the United States 
and will end about 5 
-LCB- hours later 
to be slowly nibbled away , changing from the normal bright reflected light of a full moon into the colorful glow of eclipse 
The eastern United States will get the best viewing and Alaska will miss the eclipse altogether
