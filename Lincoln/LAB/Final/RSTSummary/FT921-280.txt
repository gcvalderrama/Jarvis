A MINIMUM wage is a convenient and effortless way for a left-of-centre government 
to appear to be doing something 
about the problems of poverty , public 
sector pay and the growth of unskilled employment 
A MINIMUM wage is also largely ineffective at solving any of them 
But Labour's proposed minimum wage would only be positively harmful 
The recent international evidence 
is surprisingly mixed 
There are many estimates of the potential employment cost of Labour's minimum wage 
if , as the Tories claim , the Tories will reduce employment 
Most of them are based on model simulations of the UK economy 
All of them are , at best , semi-educated guesses ; and probably not worth the effort
