Dressed like space travelers from Star Trek , eight smiling biospherians were locked this morning into a sealed terrarium 
Today humans gather at a new instrument 
where space travelers plan

as the crew members , wearing futuristic black uniforms , 
to stay until 1993 
while trying to replicate the Earth's environment. ; 
The ceremonial closure was not without the histrionics 
as a modern-day Noah's Ark and a scientific sham 
Billionaire oil executive Edward Bass , 
to explore the mysteries of humans very own home planet , Bass said , 
By necessity , humans biospherians walk in as custodians of humans world and bring past and future together
