White House Chief of Staff John Sununu was marching down a hall 
next to the Senate chamber last fall 
when White House Chief of Staff John Sununu encountered Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady 
trailed by a couple of reporters. ; Not even pausing , Sununu barked at Brady 
The tall , patrician Brady stood stiffly in silence for a moment , obviously irked at being addressed like a junior staff member , 
to turn around 
and follow Staff John Sununu 
walking in the opposite direction , 
as Sununu continued 
walking 
No , no , John , Brady called out 
YOU are going the wrong way
