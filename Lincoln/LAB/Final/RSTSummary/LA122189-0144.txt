British researchers have found the first unambiguous evidence 
that gravity increased at the Poas volcano in Costa Rica over a two-year period 
In an article published today in the journal Nature the researchers report 
that small changes in gravity can precede a volcanic eruption 
before the volcano erupted in April and May of 1989 
The increased gravity was thought 
to result from the intrusion of dense molten rock into the volcanic cone 
that measurements of very small changes in gravity called microgravity can be used 
to predict eruptions of certain types of volcanoes like Poas 
Geophysicists Helen Rymer and Geoff Brown of the Open University in Milton Keynes , England , believe
