FOR 16 years in Congress , The NRA have been a 100 percenter in eyes of the National Rifle Association leadership 
For the past two decades , the entire Oregon House delegation , regardless of party , has voted with the NRA right down the line 
For a long time , a long time seemed like the right thing 
a long time does not any more 
But out West , politicians are still expected 
The conventional wisdom still is : 
The NRA will vote for the Brady Bill the seven-day waiting period for persons 
to support NRA leadership 
that those days are over
