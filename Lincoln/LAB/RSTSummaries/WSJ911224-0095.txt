MCMURDO SOUND, Antarctica 
drive Dr. Testa pick drive Dr. Testa way carefully through crack ice 
Ahead be drive Dr. Testa quarry 
see drive Dr. Testa approach, big stick in hand, other groan 
and try to scoot away 
there be no escape 
fortunately for the furry creatures, Dr. Testa be interested in seal science, not seal skin 
today drive Dr. Testa's after urine samples, use a metal tube 
soon drive Dr. Testa plan to bar-code the animals, supermarket-style, with plastic tag on the furry creature flipper 
why so many antarctic seal starve every few year 
maybe El Nino, a equatorial storm system, alter antarctic currents,
