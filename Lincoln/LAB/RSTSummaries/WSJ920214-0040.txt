that deferment 
but in a letter Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton's write at the time, Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton's say Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton's drop the deferment 
to maintain he ' political viability . 
and it appear that Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton's do not actually subject Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton's to the draft
