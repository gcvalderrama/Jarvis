 U.S. economy  generate  new job 
there  Congress  dictate  wage minimum level 
bad news  Brock  compromise  oppose   Reagan 
increase minimum  raise  minimum wage  upward  wage scale  damage 
 Brock  ready  bad news 
we  think  mere coincidence 
 labor  make  pitch  strong   Restoration  Minimum  Kennedy bill 
 Brock  say  and  promote  politician  union  benefit  concede 
 Restoration  Minimum  Kennedy bill  head  minimum wage  upward 
 base  such argument  or  economy illiteracy  hypocrisy 
union argument candid  hold  raise  general 
 have  price  minimum wage  upward  job 
 every increase  minimum wage  upward  percentage 
 Kennedy  labor  assert  interest  threaten
