# ::snt ; John T. Estes, president of the International Council of Cruise Lines, which represents the owners of most of the ocean-going cruise vessels, said that his organization favored all the proposed new rules, but not the proposed effective dates. ; When the safety committee met in May, it was considering phasing-in dates for the regulations beyond 1994 for new ships, possibly as late as 2010 for removal from service of vessels that can not meet the new rules. ; Estes said that accounting for the lead time required for ship design, his organization favors 1996 for enforcing the rules on new construction and major reconstruction. ; The 15 major cruise ships that call in New York have passed inspections without difficulty, according to Comdr. Anthony Dupree, chief of the inspection department of the Coast Guard in New York
