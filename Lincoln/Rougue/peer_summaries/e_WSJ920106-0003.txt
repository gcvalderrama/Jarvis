The Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) ha given welcome relief to home day care provider . A recent ruling allows provider to deduct cost associated with any area of their home that is used regularly and is available for day care . The recent ruling is a reversal of a previous position in which the care provider wa required to account for each hour of use of each room in the home . The old ruling led to protest and bill in Congress . The new ruling will save the provider much paperwork , preclude both the payment of higher tax and an increase in child care charge .
