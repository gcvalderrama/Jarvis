A new U.S. Census Bureau survey of how child are cared for and the ability of low-income family to afford care will bolster legislation to aid low-income family , which is currently under consideration . In 1987 , 55 % of mother with child under five were employed . Organized day care center cared for 2.2 million ( almost one quarter ) of these child with an average weekly cost of $ 49 . Children living at the poverty level usually are cared for by relative , although many mother would prefer organized child- care facility , which could cost one fourth of their income . Current legislation would help with cost and broaden choice .
