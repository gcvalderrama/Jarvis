High quality , affordable child care is becoming a larger issue . In addressing the problem , the high cost of child care and the low pay of worker must be considered . In a well run center , only about half of the gross revenue is available for wage . Child-care worker earn le than 60 % per hour of other female worker with an equal education . Higher wage can be achieved in only three way : a reduction in overhead expense ; a rise in revenue per child ; or an increase in the child/worker ratio . American parent seem unable to pay more and unwilling to increase the child/worker ratio .
