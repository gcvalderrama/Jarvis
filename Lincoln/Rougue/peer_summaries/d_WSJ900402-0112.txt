New mother returning to work are calling for high quality affordable child care . Many employed parent complain that licensed child care is too expensive and cause them to accept day-care of uncertain quality . Licensed child-care worker are already paid about 40 % lower salary than other woman . They are willing to accept low wage because they are likely to be married with three or more child and therefore need to work close to home . The National Academy of Sciences urge additional government support for child care and recommends a tightening of the standard regulating the ratio of child to day-care worker . If day care worker were required to handle fewer child , the cost of day care would increase in order to keep the already low salary of day care worker stable .
