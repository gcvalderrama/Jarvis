The world of child care is loaded with pitfall . These danger include : the unequal distribution of employee child care leave benefit to only one sex ; development of a caste system based on distribution of benefit by employer to the favored few ; the fear of woman that child care problem will interfere with job prospect ; and the resentment by other employee against parent employee who receive benefit . These conflict pit men against woman , high level employee against lower level , and employee against employer . Companies often do not recognize the legal aspect of distributing benefit to a select few and they do so at their peril .
