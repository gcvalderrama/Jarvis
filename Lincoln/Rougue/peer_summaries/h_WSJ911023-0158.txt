Companies that use selective flexibility in childcare benefit , allowing woman to take leave but not men , or letting favored employee cut special deal , invite discrimination suit and breed resentment . The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission issued guideline stating that employer offering leave to mother must offer the same leave to father , but President Bush ha threatened to veto a family-Leave bill mandating unpaid leave for most worker . Businesses say it infringes on their flexibility to plan for their own labor need , and that poor performer and easily replaceable employee should not get special childcare arrangement because it would not benefit shareholder .
