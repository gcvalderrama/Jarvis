A new report from a child-care advocacy group discussed 29 small-company ( fewer than 250 employee ) program . Experiments include day-care center , subsidy , referral service , flexible benefit program , and dependent-care assistance plan . Many company report employee morale is up , hiring is easier , turnover is down , and community image is enhanced .
