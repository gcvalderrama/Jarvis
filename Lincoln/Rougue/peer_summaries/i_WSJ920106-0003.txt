The Internal Revenue Service made it easier for day-care provider to claim a tax deduction for the business use of their home . The ruling will allow licensed provider to deduct cost associated with any area of their home that is used regularly for day care . The provider is not required to keep record of the specific hour of usage of each room . This is a complete reversal of the IRS position last April , which provider feared would force a rise in day-care cost . According to Tom Copeland of Resources for Child Caring , `` this is the way provider have been doing it for a number of year . ''
