With more two-paycheck couples around, Nannies have become a hot
commodity. 500 agencies exist nationally to supply them for fees of
$400-$2500. Most nannies are young women with child-care experience
but little formal training. Screening involves getting childcare and
character references and checking background. Weekly salaries range
from $150-$450 or more plus room and board, and sometimes health
insurance, paid vacations and holidays, and use of a car. Problems
sometimes arise resulting from inadequate screening, lack of
compatibility, or disputes over agency fees. The International Nanny
Association is pushing for national standards and training
credentials.
