U.S. corporations are joining together in the establishment of child
care centers.  This trend results from productivity loss brought on by
the shortage and the high cost of quality child care.

Corporate dollars are making the difference.  In the new centers,
child-teacher ratios are one-half the national average, and pay and
benefits are above average.  The centers are well-staffed, and often
give peace of mind to company parents.

Some corporate partnerships have provided a critical solution:
establishment of centers for the care of sick children.

Corporate collaboration may be the best response to chronic child care
problems.
