Some mothers are turning to costly agencies to find nannies to care
for their children.  Agency fees can run from $400 to $2,500 to supply
nannies.  Many of those nannies are turning out to be less than ideal.
Parents are complaining about thefts, drug use, child abuse, and
laziness after the agencies say that they have checked references of
the nannies they are supplying.  If a nanny proves to be
unsatisfactory, it is often difficult for parents to get back the
referral fees paid without filing a lawsuit. One such lawsuit was
filed after a nanny gave a prescription anti-depressant to an
eight-month-old for crying.  The baby almost died.
