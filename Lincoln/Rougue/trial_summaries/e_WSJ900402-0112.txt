Employed parents are currently facing the problem of an increasing
need for affordable and quality child care.  Licensed child care is
often too expensive, thus forcing working parents to accept lower
quality care.
      
Child care is not without its inherent problems. It is plagued by the
need to improve its standards as well as employee pay and education.
Its employees also lack a collective bargaining position.

An increase in the child worker ratio probably offers the best hope
for a solution.  This choice should be made by parents and providers
rather than someone concerned with the economics of child care.
