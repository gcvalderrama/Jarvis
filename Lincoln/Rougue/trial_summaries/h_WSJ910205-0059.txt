Kinder-Care Learning Centers, the nation's largest daycare center
operator with 1258 centers, is struggling to restructure its debt
after missing interest payments on loans. President J. Phillip Samper
resigned after his effort to reduce debt by selling the daycare
centers and leasing them back fell through.  Alabama-based Kinder-Care
plans to conserve cash by opening fewer centers. Former president and
CEO Tull Gearreald, replaced in June after a falling-out with his
partner in parent company Lodestar Group, was reinstated. Lodestar
Group is a merchant banking fund and merger advisory firm with more
than half its fund invested in Kinder-Care.
