The Internal Revenue Service made it easier for day-care providers to
claim a tax deduction for the business use of their homes.  The ruling
will allow licensed providers to deduct costs associated with any area
of their home that is used regularly for day care.  The provider is
not required to keep records of the specific hours of usage of each
room.  This is a complete reversal of the IRS position last April,
which providers feared would force a rise in day-care costs.
According to Tom Copeland of Resources for Child Caring, "this is the
way providers have been doing it for a number of years."
