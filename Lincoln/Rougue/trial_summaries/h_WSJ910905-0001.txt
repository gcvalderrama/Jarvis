Some small companies, in spite of limited resources, are offering
employees childcare benefits such as referral services, subsidies, or
on-site daycare centers. Companies offering benefits are often owned
by parents with childcare needs of their own, or employ a high
percentage of women. Offering childcare benefits is good for a
business's image, plus morale and productivity go up, hiring is
easier, maternity leaves are shorter, and turnover drops as much as
50%. Problems include administrative hassles that sap a small staff
and complaints of inequitable benefits by non-parents. Small companies
must also be careful to limit liability.
