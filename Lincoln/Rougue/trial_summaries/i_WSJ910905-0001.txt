While small companies are not expected to be able to offer child-care
benefits, some are trying anyway.  A new report from a child-care
advocacy group discussed 29 small-company (fewer than 250 employees)
programs.  Experiments include day-care centers, subsidies, referral
services, flexible benefit programs, and dependent-care assistance
plans.  Many companies report employees morale is up, hiring is
easier, turnover is down, and community image is enhanced.  Problems
include haggling over zoning and building-code regulations, trying to
limit liability for safety, skimping on staff, the inability to hire
consultants, and employee abuse.  Not all companies will be able to
continue.
