New mothers returning to work are calling for high quality affordable
child care.  Many employed parents complain that licensed child care
is too expensive and causes them to accept day-care of uncertain
quality.  Licensed child-care workers are already paid about 40% lower
salaries than other women.  They are willing to accept low wages
because they are likely to be married with three or more children and
therefore need to work close to home.

The National Academy of Sciences urges additional government supports
for child care and recommends a tightening of the standards regulating
the ratio of children to day-care workers.  If day care workers were
required to handle fewer children, the cost of day care would increase
in order to keep the already low salaries of day care workers stable.
