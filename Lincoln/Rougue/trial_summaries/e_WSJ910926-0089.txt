Statistics show that, in spite of the growing public and private
investment in the U.S. child care system, about one-half of employed
mothers paying for child care change their providers each year.  The
reasons include high cost, hours or location are inconvenient, an
unhappy child or parent dislike of a caregiver, or the caregiver
resigns.

The breakdown of child care arrangements is expensive for employees
and it is responsible for about 15 percent in lost work time.
Disruption often occurs without notice.  As more women enter the work
force, there are fewer relatives available to act as a replacement.
