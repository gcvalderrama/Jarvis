Tull Gearreald has returned to Kinder Care Learning Centers, Inc., as
president and chief executive officer.  J. Phillip Samper, who
succeeded Gearreald in June, resigned.

Kinder Care, of Montgomery, Alabama, is the nation's largest day care
center operator.  The change comes as the corporation is struggling to
restructure its debt.

Mr. Samper, a management expert, attempted to reduce the corporation's
debt by selling off some of its centers in a lease-back plan; however,
bank credit dried up.

Kinder Care rehired Gearreald for his financial expertise and his
popularity with employees.

Corporation efforts will be toward restructuring and opening fewer
centers.
