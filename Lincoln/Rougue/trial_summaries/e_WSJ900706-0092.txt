In the search for child care, turning to a high profile agency is no
guarantee of reliable service.  It may result in a lawsuit for poor or
negligent service.

The increasing number of two-paycheck parents searching for nannies
has resulted in a proliferation of child care agencies.  Most do a
good job.  For those that do not, complaints include unchecked
references, deficient screening, broken contracts and unrefunded fees.
Complaints against nannies include poor training and child abuse.

In an attempt to prevent abuses within this burgeoning industry, some
organizations are establishing national standards and training
credentials for nannies.
