A US Census bureau survey on childcare and low-income families could
provide fuel for legislation already in congress.  According to Helen
Bank a childcare expert with the Children's Defense Fund, legislation
now in Congress "would help with costs and widen choices" for
low-income families.
 
The results confirm that poor families pay a higher percentage of
their family income for child care services than do higher income
families.  The survey shows that an average of about 25% of the
lower-income families' weekly resources are spent on childcare while
only 6% of higher-income families' weekly earnings goes to childcare.
