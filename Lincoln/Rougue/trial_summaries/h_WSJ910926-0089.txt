Daycare problems are costly to employers. Arrangements frequently
breakdown and employees lose time lose from work. Half of employed
mothers change paid daycare arrangements each year because of a
caregiver quitting, high cost, wrong hours, inconvenient location, an
unhappy child, or a parent's dislike of a caregiver.  Relatives who
provide daycare have dwindled as more women go to work. Plus over the
next three decades, the number of dependent elders may surpass the
number of dependent children in the U.S., depending on birth and death
rates and the number of immigrants. Public pressure is likely to shift
to demands for more eldercare help.
