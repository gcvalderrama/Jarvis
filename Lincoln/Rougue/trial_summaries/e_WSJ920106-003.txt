The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has given welcome relief to home
day care providers.  A recent ruling allows providers to deduct costs
associated with any area of their home that is used regularly and is
available for day care.

The recent ruling is a reversal of a previous position in which the
care provider was required to account for each hour of use of each
room in the home.  The old ruling led to protests and bills in
Congress.

The new ruling will save the provider much paperwork, preclude both
the payment of higher taxes and an increase in child care charges.
