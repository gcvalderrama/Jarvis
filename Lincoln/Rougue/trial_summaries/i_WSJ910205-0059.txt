Kinder-Care Learning Centers Inc. brought back Tull Gearreald as
president and CEO, replacing J. Phillip Samper who resigned.
Gearreald had been interim CEO from last February to June, before
being replaced by Samper.  A professional manager, Samper's plans to
generate income and reduce debt had failed.  According to Ken Miller,
the company chairman, the 45 year-old Gearreald, was rehired because
he knows the company, is "financially sophisticated and is popular
with employees."  While a restructuring study is under way, he plans
to conserve cash by opening fewer centers.  Kinder-Care stock was up
15.625.
