Companies that use selective flexibility in childcare benefits,
allowing women to take leave but not men, or letting favored employees
cut special deals, invite discrimination suits and breed
resentment. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission issued
guidelines stating that employers offering leave to mothers must offer
the same leave to fathers, but President Bush has threatened to veto a
family-Leave bill mandating unpaid leave for most workers. Businesses
say it infringes on their flexibility to plan for their own labor
needs, and that poor performers and easily replaceable employees
should not get special childcare arrangements because it would not
benefit shareholders.
