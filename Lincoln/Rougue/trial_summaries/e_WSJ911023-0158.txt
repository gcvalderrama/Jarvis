The world of child care is loaded with pitfalls.

These dangers include: the unequal distribution of employee child care
leave benefits to only one sex; development of a caste system based on
distribution of benefits by employers to the favored few; the fears of
women that child care problems will interfere with job prospects; and
the resentment by other employees against parent employees who receive
benefits.

These conflicts pit men against women, high level employees against
lower level, and employee against employer.

Companies often do not recognize the legal aspects of distributing
benefits to a select few and they do so at their peril.
