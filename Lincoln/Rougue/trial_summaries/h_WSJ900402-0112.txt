 
The need for high quality affordable child care is growing as half of
all new mothers return to paid employment within a year. Licensed
child care is expensive while provider wages, dependent on revenue per
child and overhead, are the lowest of any major occupation, 30-60
percent less than for kindergarten or elementary school teachers, who
are likely to have four more years of schooling and be highly
unionized.  The French daycare system, whose workers are as well
educated and paid as elementary school teachers, is often hailed as a
model for the U.S. although its child/worker ratio is double.
