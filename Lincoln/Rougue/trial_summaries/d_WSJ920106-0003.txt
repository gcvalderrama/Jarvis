The Internal Revenue Service now allows licensed day-care provider to
deduct costs for any portion of their home used for regular day care
during any part of the day.  No records are required for specific
hours of usage and a room does not have to be used every business day
to quality.

IRS Ruling 923 is a new position since last April when the IRS had a
dispute with one woman.  They wanted her to account for each hour of
use of each room in her home.  Now a provider can count any rooms used
for a portion of the day as long as they are regularly used and
available for day care.
