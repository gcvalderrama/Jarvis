Small companies that try to provide day-care centers for their
employees often run into financial problems.  Generally, there may not
be enough children to support the cost of running a center.  Some
companies are solving this problem by opening up the centers to the
public.  In other cases, small company-run day care centers have been
good for business.  They say that hiring is easier, maternity leaves
are shorter and turnover is off by as much as 50%.

Still, small businesses face a tougher time than big businesses in
offering child-care benefits.  One problem is caused by not having
enough employees to handle administrative hassles such as meeting
zoning and building-code regulations.
