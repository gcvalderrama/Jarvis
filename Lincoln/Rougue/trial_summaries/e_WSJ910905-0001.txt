Firms offering their employees child care benefits solve a difficult
problem for parents.  For the small firm, however, it can be a frantic
exercise in the manipulation of scant resources.

Benefits include subsidies, referrals, flexible benefit programs, and
dependent care assistance plans.

Small companies do not attract enough children to prevent the care
center from running a deficit, forcing centers to close.  Small firms
must also limit their liability for child safety.

Many company owners, however, have an interest in keeping such centers
viable when they enroll their own children.  They believe the centers
are good for business and help morale.
