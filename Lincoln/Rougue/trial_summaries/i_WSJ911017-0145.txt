A growing number of big companies are joining joint ventures to try
creative solutions to the nation's child-care problems, believed to
cost U.S. business some $3 billion a year.  Corporate dollars, aimed
at raising the supply and quality of care, are beginning to make a
difference.  Joint day-care centers have been built.  Other programs
are creating new slots for children in family day-care centers.
Programs also offer incentives for professional training programs that
focus on health and safety issues and entrepreneurship.  Other
companies have found that even a small increase in employee benefits,
such as low-cost health benefits, have a big impact on turnover and
credentials of child-care workers.
