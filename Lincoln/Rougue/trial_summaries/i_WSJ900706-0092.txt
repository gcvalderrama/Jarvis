With ever more two-paycheck couples, nannies have become a hot
commodity.  More than 500 placements agencies have sprung up
nation-wide.  Many do a conscientious job, but some dissatisfied
customers tell of unchecked references, deficient screening, broken
contracts and unrefunded fees.  Many nannies are recruited from rural
areas in the West or Midwest and have little formal training.
Matching nannies to families is a delicate process and some nannies
have problems adjusting to the cities.  Parents warn "consumer
beware", while agencies point out that some families are problems.  A
nanny advocacy group is pushing for national standards and training
credentials for caregivers.
