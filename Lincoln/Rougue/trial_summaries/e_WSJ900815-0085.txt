A recent 1977-1987 Census Bureau survey reports major trends in child
care in the U.S. and indicates concern about the affordability of
child care by the poor.

The use of relatives as day care providers declined, probably
reflecting in part the greater number of female relatives of poorer
families who entered the work force.

According to the survey, poor families spend about one fourth of their
income on probably less quality child care. This compares with one
sixth spent by higher income families.

The report could support current congressional legislation to provide
financial assistance to low income families.
