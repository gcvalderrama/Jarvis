Many child-care centers are becoming surrogate extended families to
increase appeal.  They are becoming more flexible, including 24-7
availability and convenient locations, and offering novel services
such as vacationer/conventioneer support, recreational classes,
transportation service, and take-home meals.  At the same time they
have developed sophisticated marketing strategies to actually make
money in an industry with a tight profit margin.  Their target clients
are affluent, two-income families and corporations.  Parents need more
than traditional day care and some are willing to pay for it and
employers are willing to subsidize it.  Successful companies include
Sunrise Preschools Inc. and Lakeshore Teaching and Learning Center.
