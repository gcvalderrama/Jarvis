In order to make high-quality day care affordable, many large
corporations are joining together to stretch their child-care
dollars. The high cost to corporations to set up quality day care for
their employees have caused some corporations to work together.  They
are pooling funds to provide centers with more teachers per child
allowing specialized care.  The increase in teachers also provides a
calmer environment that is reflected in better behavior of the
children.

Joint efforts allow teachers to be paid better and receive benefits
such as health care.  This tends to decrease the turn over of child
care providers and increase the quality of applicants.
