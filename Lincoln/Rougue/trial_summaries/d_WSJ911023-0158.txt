Paid child-care leave has not been extended equally among workers in
some companies especially if the person requesting the leave happens
to be a man. In some cases when both men and women have been denied
the same benefits received by some women in the same offices, they
have chosen to resign and seek employment elsewhere.

Corporate attorneys warn that employers are failing to establish
policies protecting themselves from the pitfalls of giving benefits to
the few.  A Pittsburgh court ruled against a company that refused a
male employee the same parental leave that was offered to a woman.
The Equal Opportunity commission cited that case when it issued new
guidelines stating that employers must offer the same leave to both
men and women.
