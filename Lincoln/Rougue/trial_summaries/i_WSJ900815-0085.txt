A new U.S. Census Bureau survey of how children are cared for and the
ability of low-income families to afford care will bolster legislation
to aid low-income families, which is currently under consideration.
In 1987, 55% of mothers with children under five were employed.
Organized day care centers cared for 2.2 million (almost one quarter)
of these children with an average weekly cost of $49.  Children living
at the poverty level usually are cared for by relatives, although many
mothers would prefer organized child- care facilities, which could
cost one fourth of their income.  Current legislation would help with
costs and broaden choices.
