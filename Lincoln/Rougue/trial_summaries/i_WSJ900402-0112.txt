High quality, affordable child care is becoming a larger issue.  In
addressing the problem, the high cost of child care and the low pay of
workers must be considered.  In a well run center, only about half of
the gross revenue is available for wages.  Child-care workers earn
less than 60% per hour of other female workers with an equal
education.  Higher wages can be achieved in only three ways: a
reduction in overhead expenses; a rise in revenue per child; or an
increase in the child/worker ratio.  American parents seem unable to
pay more and unwilling to increase the child/worker ratio.
