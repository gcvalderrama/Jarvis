Worried that a shortage of high-quality childcare is hurting
productivity, a growing number of companies are forming joint ventures
to stretch benefit dollars.  Creative solutions include subsidizing
facilities and efforts to win accreditation, offering childcare
workers incentives to get professional training and health benefits to
improve retention and quality, promoting new home-based centers, and
building centers of their own. The biggest collaboration so far is a
two million dollar center in Charlotte, NC, financed by IBM and four
partners, open to sponsors' employees and the public. Allstate
Insurance published a guidebook to help managers seek out childcare
collaborators.
