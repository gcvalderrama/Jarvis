As the problem of child care for working parents continues to fester,
employers' selective flexibility is creating a new cast system.  The
conflict pits men against women, mothers against other mothers,
professional women against nonprofessionals, and children's needs
against those of the employers.  The family-leave bill, mandating
unpaid leave for most workers, would even things out.  President Bush
and business are against it.  Corporate attorneys warn of legal
pitfalls associated with the failure to establish policies for
child-care issues such as job security, maternity benefits, granting
flexible schedules, and cost of company child care.  Thus far
employees seem to be seething rather than suing.
