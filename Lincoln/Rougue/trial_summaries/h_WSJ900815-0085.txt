 
A new Census Bureau survey showing how children are cared for in the
US increases concern about affordable childcare for low-income
families and could bolster childcare legislation now in
Congress. Childcare costs average 25% of income for poor families and
6% for the better off. The proportion of children in daycare doubled
from 1977 to 1987. Fewer relatives are used as daycare providers,
reflecting the increase in working women. 66% of preschoolers are
cared for in their homes or the homes of others. Many low-income women
would prefer the developmental benefits of center-based preschool but
can't afford it.
