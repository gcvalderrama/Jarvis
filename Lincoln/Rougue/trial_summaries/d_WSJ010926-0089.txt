Child-care arrangements remain unreliable despite growing public and
private investment in child-care systems.  About one-half of employed
mothers who pay for child care change care givers each year. About 345
out of 2,300 women surveyed reported lost time from work in the past
month.  The problem cost employers about $3 billion annually.

Working mothers can no longer depend on relatives to provide day-care
on a regular or emergency basis.  More and more women have taken other
jobs and are not available to care for young family members.  Other
day-care workers often quit with little or no notice leaving mothers
with no alternative but to take time off from work until they can make
new arrangements.
