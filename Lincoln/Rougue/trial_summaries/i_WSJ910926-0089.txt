Working parents' child-care arrangements continue to break down
frequently, despite a growing investment in the system.  About one

each year, according to one study.  The hours or location is wrong or
participants do not get along.  Additionally the supply of relatives
to help has dwindled as more women take jobs.  The annual cost to
U.S. business of lost work to solve child-care problems is put at $3
billion by an advocacy group.
