The IRS issued a ruling that makes it easier for daycare providers to
claim tax deductions for business use of their homes. Licensed
providers may now deduct costs associated with any area of their home
that is used regularly for daycare even if not used for that purpose
every hour of the business day. The provider is not required to keep
records of specific hours of usage. The ruling came about as a result
of protest over an audit dispute last April, in which the IRS sought
to have the provider account for each hour of use of each room.
