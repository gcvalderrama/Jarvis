Many child-care centers are becoming surrogate extended families to
harried working parents.  Some facilities provide child-care any time
of day or night.  Some offer gym and swimming classes, and
transportation to baseball and soccer games.

Many elaborate child-care centers are making money in an industry with
tight profit margins.  Corporations commonly subsidize off-site spaces
for day care that are within 10 to 20 minutes away and pay upwards of
30% of the cost of tuition for their employees.  For example, Sunrise
Preschools, Inc. runs a 24 hours, seven-day-a week center to
accommodate America West Airlines flight attendants, baggage handlers
and other employees with diverse work schedules.
