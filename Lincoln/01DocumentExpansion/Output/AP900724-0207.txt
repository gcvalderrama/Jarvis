In a state with few people, the city with the most wins the power game 
In Nevada, that makes Las Vegas the undisputed champ 
Las Vegas, which welcomes as many as 6,000 new residents a month, is the reason Nevada is the nation's fastest-growing state 
The city's population is expected to reach 1 million by 1995, four times what it was in 1980 
An estimated 800,000 people live there now, out of 1.3 million in the state as a whole 
The three rural counties fighting Clark County's water plan have a combined population of less than 35,000 
That means Clark County controls the Nevada Legislature : 36 of 63 state lawmakers are from the Las Vegas area, and the contingent is sure to grow with next year's reapportionment 
So what Clark County wants, Clark County has the numbers to get 
" If there's something in state water law we can hang our hat on to deter this plan, the power is in Las Vegas and Clark County and they 'll just go ahead and change the law, " said Steve Bradhurst, a consultant to the rural counties 
Las Vegas also is the state's financial anchor 
Last year, Clark County casinos accounted for 70 percent of the state's $ 4.6 billion in gaming revenues 
Clark County needs to keep growing for the state's economic health, officials say 
" There is one large metropolitan area from which the bulk of all revenues in this state come, and that's Clark County, " said Pat Mulroy, manager of the Las Vegas Valley Water District 
" If 


it goes downhill, the whole state goes downhill .
