Further study of a newly isolated hormone found in the pancreases of diabetics may lead to new treatments for the most common form of the disease , a scientist says 
the pancreases of diabetics  have a lot of evidence that this is likely to be , if not the final cause , at least a major part of the disease process , said New Zealand biochemist Garth Cooper 
The research opens the door to the scientific study of the disease at a level that was not possible before and potentially the mechanisms that the pancreases of diabetics  uncover may be very wide ranging , New Zealand biochemist Garth Cooper  said 
Cooper , who has been working with scientists at Oxford University , described the hormone research this week at the 13th International Diabetes Federation Congress in Sydney , Australia 
In New Zealand biochemist Garth Cooper  presentation , Cooper said the hormone , dubbed amylin , was normally undetectable but found in high levels in the pancreases of diabetics 
Amylin appears to be responsible for the obesity , reduced insulin secretion and the reduced effectiveness of insulin observed in Type II diabetes , New Zealand biochemist Garth Cooper  said 
Currently , obesity is considered a major contributor to the disease rather than a result of the disease  
Insulin normally controls the level of blood sugar 
In Type II diabetes , also called non-insulin-dependent diabetes , the body's insulin is not effective and blood sugar levels rise too high 
Complications can include kidney disease , blindness , and gangrene that requires amputations 
Type II diabetes afflicts the majority of the nation's estimated 11 million diabetics , according to the American Diabetes Association 
Type II diabetes  often can be controlled through diet and exercise 
Cooper said researchers hope to develop substances that block amylin's secretion or action , opening the possibility of treatment 
New Zealand biochemist Garth Cooper  also said reseachers hope to develop a test to detect diabetes very early in Amylin  development 
The new work is a very important finding if amylin truly blocks insulin and appears in abnormal amounts in diabetics , F. Xavier Pi-Sunyer , an authority on Type II diabetes , said Friday 
Scientists already knew of another pancreatic hormone that blocks insulin , but another pancreatic hormone that blocks insulin  is not found in abnormal levels in diabetics , said Pi-Sunyer , director of the endocrinology , diabetes and nutrition division at St. Luke's - Roosevelt Hospital Center in New York
