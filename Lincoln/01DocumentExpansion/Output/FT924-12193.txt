MR Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, yesterday gave China until the end of the year to accept his proposals for the colony's political development or to present alternatives that would be acceptable to the people of Hong Kong 
After more than six hours of discussions with Lu Ping, director of the Chinese cabinet's office of Hong Kong and Macao affairs, Mr Patten said : ' I can not say we reached a meeting of minds on what I put forward . 
Lu Ping also indicated that the people of Hong Kong achieved little progress in settling the impasse over the financing of Hong Kong's new airport project 
Mr Patten said that the people of Hong Kong had agreed the best forum for settlement was the Airport Committee of the Anglo-Chinese Joint Liaison Group - a place where consensus has been stalled for months 
This is Mr Patten's first visit to China as governor of Hong Kong 
MR Chris Patten leaves for the colony tomorrow after discussions today with Chinese trade officials 
the colony tomorrow emerged last night that Li Peng, China's prime minister, had refused to see Li Peng 
Instead Li Peng will meet Qian Qichen, China's foreign minister 
On October 7, Mr Patten presented plans for the conduct of the colony's 1994 local and 1995 legislative elections which provide for much greater democracy than has previously been the case in Hong Kong 
In considering alternatives to these plans, the governor said MR Chris Patten was guided by three principles 
They should be ` fair ', ` open and honest ', and ` acceptable to the people of Hong Kong ', MR Chris Patten said 
Mr Patten said that MR Chris Patten was prepared to meet Lu ` at any time and in any place ' to reach agreement but had reminded the Chinese they had only until the end of the year 
MR Chris Patten said the legislative timetable demanded that bills be put before the Legislative Council (LegCo -RRB-, the colony's unicameral legislature, early in the new year to give effect to the planned changes for the 1994 and 1995 elections 
Although Mr Patten did not say so yesterday, MR Chris Patten has suggested in the past that MR Chris Patten would be prepared to introduce MR Chris Patten proposals for a slightly faster pace of democratic development in Hong Kong without China's approval 
MR Chris Patten went out of MR Chris Patten way, however, to praise Lu - the man who holds day-to-day responsibility for ensuring a smooth transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997 
MR Chris Patten lauded the manner in which Lu put forward China's position but was less than pleased with what Lu Ping had to say 
Mr Patten would give only few details of Lu's response to MR Chris Patten proposals 
MR Chris Patten said that Lu pointed out the existence of the Basic Law - the Beijing-drafted constitution for Hong Kong post-1997 
(This has become Chinese code for ` no change ' . )
I am bound to say I do n't think this answers some of the problems I have to disentangle before the end of this year, ' the governor said 
His visit has been preceded by a barrage of criticism of himself and his proposals, in the pro-Beijing Hong Kong press, not seen since the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s and early 1970s 
Mr Patten's defeat in the British parliamentary election earlier this year has been used to suggest MR Chris Patten is a failed politician
