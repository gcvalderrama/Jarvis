On the untouched expanse of the Arctic icecap [it(PRP)| the untouched expanse of the Arctic icecap(NN)] seemed a mirage _ preposterous , incredible : ski tracks . 
Will Steger , leading the first unsupported dogsled trek to the North Pole since Adm. Robert Peary 's , saw the unmistakable evidence of cross-country skis . 
He knew they could only be those of Jean-Louis Etienne , a Frenchman who was about to become the first man to ski alone to the pole . 
It was in April 1986 , in a tent on the monotonous frozen landscape , that the two adventurers sipped tea and dreamed of [their(PRP$)| the two adventurers(NNS)] next quest : a multinational trek across Antarctica . 
After reaching [their(PRP$)| the two adventurers(NNS)] destination , [they(PRP)| the two adventurers(NNS)] began planning the Trans-Antarctica Expedition , which is to begin Aug. 1 . 
[Their(PRP$)| the two adventurers(NNS)] previous exploits were for the sheer joy of pitting man against nature . 
This one would do that and more : draw attention to threats against nature and to the need for international cooperation in protecting Antarctica . 
Steger and Etienne enlisted scientists and explorers from the Soviet Union , China , Japan and Great Britain for a seven-month , 4,000-mile trip . 
Others have crossed Antarctica on snowmobiles and giant snow tractors , but this will be the first unmechanized attempt . 
Victor Boyarsky of the Soviet Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute , a popular explorer and veteran of polar travel , is a co-leader . 
The other members of the team are glaciologist Qin Dahe of China ; Geoff Somers , who has spent 42 months in Antarctica with the British Antarctic Survey ; and Keizo Funatsu of Japan , a former economist who turned to dog-sledding and adventure . 
Somers will plot the trek 's course ; Funatsu is in charge of the dogs . 
Steger , who in the past has picked [his(PRP$)| Steger(NNP)] own teams , says [he(PRP)| Steger(NNP)] is honored that the Soviet Union and China will be sending official representatives . 
The four members from Western nations are not formally backed by [their(PRP$)| The four members from Western nations(NNS)] governments . 
Steger recalled that when [he(PRP)| Steger(NNP)] asked if Boyarsky spoke English , a Soviet official replied : `` In one year , [he(PRP)| Victor Boyarsky of the Soviet Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute(NNP)] will speak English very well . '' 
`` A real interesting diplomatic challenge , '' Steger called [it(PRP)| A real interesting diplomatic challenge(NN)] . 
Other international support includes the use of China 's Great Wall Station on King George Island as a staging point . 
New Zealanders stationed at the Scott McArdle base donated 12 dogs whose lineage can be traced to dogs owned by polar explorer Richard Byrd . 
The Soviet Union provided an icebreaker to transport 15 tons of food for the men and 36 dogs ; the provisions were cached on the route in November . 
The USSR also plans to send a military cargo plane to pick up the team from [its(PRP$)| a military cargo plane(NN)] rendezvous at Steger 's Minnesota camp ; the U.S. State Department , while not officially sanctioning the trek , is expected to let the plane land . 
After refueling in Cuba , the team will fly to the Great Wall Base , about 600 miles south of the tip of South America . 
The expedition , which will set out in the middle of the Austral winter , will at first follow known landmarks . 
`` We 'll have maps for the first 1,500 miles . 
The last 2,500 miles there is virtually nothing . 
It 's flat . 
There 's nothing to map , '' Steger said . 
They 'll cross the Ellsworth Mountains and skirt Mt. Vinson , the continent 's highest spot at 16,860 feet . 
They 'll visit three American bases _ Palmer , Siple and Amundsen-Scott at the South Pole , where [they(PRP)| Palmer , Siple and Amundsen-Scott(NNP)] plan to celebrate Christmas . 
The next dot of civilization they 'll aim for is the Soviet base at Vostok , near the magnetic south pole . 
Vostok , the coldest place on Earth , will serve as a base for a French documentary film crew that will travel with the expedition for three weeks , and for the team 's pilot . 
By March , the trekkers should reach the Soviet base of Mirnyy on the east coast , also known as Queen Mary Coast , ending the longest possible traverse . 
[They(PRP)| the trekkers(NNS)] 'll be picked up by the expedition ship , built in France with a special aluminum hull designed to pop up and settle intact on top of the ice rather than be trapped and crushed . 
So far , about 45 nations have signed television contracts with the expedition . 
ABC has bought exclusive U.S. TV rights . 
`` We want the world to know much , much more about Antarctica after our expedition than [it(PRP)| the world(NN)] did before we set out , '' Steger said . 
The continent is roughly the shape of a bottle cap . 
[It(PRP)| roughly the shape of a bottle cap(NN)] rises sharply at the perimeter , then flattens out in a vast , high plateau at an average elevation of 9,500 feet . 
Antarctica 's 5.4 million square miles is more than China and India combined . 
[It(PRP)| Antarctica(NNP)] has no indigenous people , and wildlife is confined to the coast . 
A treaty signed in 1959 by a dozen nations , with additional signatories in subsequent years , put all territorial claims on Antarctica on hold , banned military activity and established freedom of scientific inquiry . 
But many countries now have designs on the land for strategic , political and even economic reasons _ some expect to find oil , coal and mineral deposits under the ice . 
Some want to see the continent cut into pie-shaped wedges , but Steger wants the people of the world to demand that it be protected , intact . 
`` It sounds like a very lofty goal , but Antarctica is a going to play a very important role in the future of the planet , '' [he(PRP)| Steger(NNP)] said . 
Planetary warming of just a few degrees could melt the polar ice caps , raising sea level and flooding coastal areas , but Steger said it 's simplistic to worry about submerged cities . 
With 85 percent of the planet 's fresh water stored in the snow and ice of Antarctica , a thaw would reduce the salinity of the oceans , change ocean currents and wreak havoc with weather patterns . 
The other environmental nightmare awakening interest in Antarctica is the discovery of a giant hole in the ozone layer directly over the continent . 
Ozone screens the planet from excess ultraviolet radiation . 
Scientists predict continued ozone depletion will increase skin cancer , but such thinking is `` myopic , '' Steger said . 
Most significantly , increased solar radiation could disrupt the reproduction cycles of plankton , the microscopic oceanic plants and animals that are the basis of the global food chain . 
These ominous changes are most apparent in Antarctica , making [it(PRP)| Antarctica(NNP)] `` like a canary in a mine , '' Steger said . 
The team will be under the ozone hole for about 40 days and 500 miles as [they(PRP)| Scientists(NNS)] cross a 13,000-foot high plateau known as the Area of Inaccessibility . 
[It(PRP)| the worst possible place on earth for ultraviolet exposure(NN)] 's the worst possible place on earth for ultraviolet exposure . 
The team will carry a monitor and Boyarsky will record ozone levels at regular intervals , the first cross-section of ozone across the continent . 
Qin will take snow and ice samples all the way across Antarctica , recording temperatures and oxygen content for a geological history of the icecap . 
Etienne , a physician , will monitor cholesterol levels of the team members , who will rely on the high-fat diet typical of cultures in cold regions . 
But the experiments that can be done along the way are limited by time and weight . 
The trekkers plan to travel 30 miles a day on cross-country skis , and the three dogsleds can carry no more than 900 pounds of gear . 
Steger admits [they(PRP)| the trekkers(NNS)] wo n't attempt `` pure science '' but [he(PRP)| Steger(NNP)] hopes the findings will contribute to the knowledge of this frontier . 
`` [We(PRP)| the trekkers(NNS)] need international cooperation . 
Solutions to environmental problems must be global . ''
