World Bank President Barber Conable was so well regarded during World Bank President Barber Conable  20-year career as a Republican congressman from New York that some journalists nicknamed World Bank President Barber Conable  H.R. for highly respected 
And to many on Capitol Hill , Mr. Conable still is 
Rep. Tom Foley , a liberal Democrat from Washington State , calls Tom Foley  a very strong asset to the 151-nation institution because of the enormous respect Tom Foley  has on both sides of the aisle 
But at the World Bank , Mr. Conable finds World Bank President Barber Conable  under fire 
After a year and a half in office , World Bank President Barber Conable  has failed to move the bank into a leadership role on the Third World debt problem 
The World Bank has been reluctant to step out on this issue in confrontation and conflict with the Treasury , charges Sen. Bill Bradley , a New Jersey Democrat and Congress's leading voice on the debt problem 
Rep. John LaFalce , a New York Democrat and another leader on the issue , agrees 
There surely is a much larger role for the World Bank in the debt problem than a much larger role for the World Bank in the debt problem  has played so far , but Rep. John LaFalce , a New York Democrat and another leader on the issue  just ca not get out ahead of the administration , John LaFalce  says 
While the debt morass has deepened , Mr. Conable's World Bank has looked inward , shuffling the debt morass  organization charts around in a disruptive reorganization and then campaigning for a $ 74.8 billion increase in its capital 
As Congress considers the increase , liberal critics on Capitol Hill are demanding that Mr. Conable show World Bank President Barber Conable  is ready to use the bank's vast resources to make some direct impact on reducing the huge burden of Third World debt 
House Democrats , in fact , cut out of the foreign-aid bill passed last month all $ 70 million the administration had sought for the first year of the U.S. share of the increase in capital 
The deletion was made pending action by a committee looking into the bank's approach to the debt crisis 
So far , Mr. Conable has approached the debt crisis more like a cautious financier than a bold politician 
World Bank President Barber Conable  has clung to the bank's traditional role of a conventional lender and adviser to developing nations and has deferred on ideas about the debt to the man who picked World Bank President Barber Conable  for World Bank President Barber Conable  job U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker 
Mr. Conable subscribes to the Baker Plan , which stresses new lending by commercial banks and the World Bank to debtor countries that adopt growth-oriented , market-based economic reforms 
The bank has tried to help the countries by tiding a conventional lender and adviser  over with some new loans 
That policy contrasts sharply with some of the more aggressive debt-reduction plans 
Sen. Bradley , worried that the debt burden stalls growth and threatens political stability in developing countries , proposes that Third World debtors be required to make certain economic reforms ; in return , Third World debtors  lending banks would forgive some of the loans and write Third World debtors  down on Third World debtors  books 
Even the World Bank's longtime financial wizard , Eugene Rotberg who quit the bank for Merrill Lynch over Mr. Conable's reorganization plan proposed last month that the World Bank guarantee new 20-year commercial-bank loans to Third World countries 
Other experts advocate a debt facility to buy and refinance the debts 
Defending Eugene Rotberg  approach to the debt problem , Mr. Conable explains : Other experts  are not a financial institution but a development institution 
Other experts  ca not go to our member countries and say , Give Other experts  a tremendous capital increase so Other experts  can assume the obligations of all these other creditors that a developing country owes 
Obviously , that would be viewed as Other experts  not performing a development function but Other experts  simply accepting other people's risks 
But critics reject that view 
Jeffrey Sachs , a Harvard economist who has offered one of many debt-reduction plans , says the World Bank's officials have the great potential to play a central role in the problem , but the World Bank's officials  are basically ducking 
There is a lack of intellectual leadership within the bank Harvard  
Even some Reagan administration officials privately despair of Mr. Conable's leadership and fear that despair of Mr. Conable's leadership and  may have been a mistake to appoint President Reagan  
While financial experts often urge the bank to do more , the ponderous institution has intervened only about half a dozen times in debt crises , usually just to guarantee a small portion of a commercial-bank loan package 
Mr. Conable makes World Bank  clear that World Bank  wo not do that often 
Recently , commercial-bank lenders to Brazil tried to get the World Bank to insure a portion of a big new loan package commercial-bank lenders to Brazil  were negotiating 
But the U.S. Treasury was firmly opposed to the idea , saying the U.S. Treasury  was unnecessary in Brazil's case and might foster the impression that such guarantees should be common 
Secretary Baker says Mr. Conable is being criticized largely by legislators and academicians who favor grand debt-relief schemes that would take the debt and put Third World debt  on the backs of the taxpayers 
U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker  will tell you who will pay for Third World debt  : you and me when legislators and academicians who favor grand debt-relief schemes that would take the debt  file legislators and academicians who favor grand debt-relief schemes that would take the debt  1040s 
Third World debt  is a bad idea 
They want Barber to subscribe to Third World debt  , and U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker  think that World Bank President Barber Conable  sees that Third World debt  is a bad idea 
Yet even inside the bank , there is increasing worry that the Third World debt totaling $ 1.19 trillion last year frustrates the bank's goals 
Because of chronic debt problems ... the development process in these countries has stalled , the World Bank said earlier this year 
Also within the bank's own ranks , there is talk that could lead to a more aggressive role on debt once President Reagan leaves office 
Baker's approach has to be adapted to the circumstances of today , says the bank's No. 2 man , Operations Vice President Moeen Qureshi 
Perhaps we have excessively underplayed our own role 
U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker  adds , our own role  seems to U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker  it will be desirable , in the present environment , to see what can be done to reduce debt , rather than just lend new money 
Partly in response to the external and internal pressures , Mr. Conable sent a debt study to World Bank President Barber Conable  board early in April 
The likelihood is that the bank will need to play a more extensive and diversified role in two areas : new money packages and facilitating other forms of financial relief , including debt-reduction schemes , declares the study , which was drafted by David Bock , a vice president and the bank's debt expert 
The document even says that for a few debtors , consensual debt relief , including outright forgiveness , might be the only workable solution , but The document  stresses that the bank must avoid moves that threaten the preservation of the bank's prime standing in financial markets 
The bank's own annual world-debt report illustrates The bank's own annual world-debt report  determination to stick to a back-seat role on the issue 
Published early this year , the report noted that the debtor countriesposition has stubbornly failed to improve , said imagination and resolve are needed , and emphasized that leadership will the debtor countriesposition  be crucially important 
But conspicuously absent from the report , which discussed debt-relief proposals from Secretary Baker , Sen. Bradley and others , were any ideas from the bank the report  
The World Bank's ethos is decidedly traditional 
Founded in 1944 , it has evolved into a well-paid bureaucracy of 6,000 working in 17 buildings a few blocks from the White House , ignored by tourists but a mandatory stop for finance ministers and bankers visiting Washington 
The bank earns more than $ 1 billion annually , sports a top credit rating in securities markets and lent nearly $ 18 billion last year 
The U.S. is The U.S.  biggest shareholder and controls the president's job 
The idea of the bank was to finance a wide range of economically basic construction across the developing world : roads in Africa , power projects in Asia , schools in Latin America , irrigation in India 
Under Robert McNamara , the bank began aiding efforts to alleviate rural poverty , control population growth and fight illiteracy 
Under A.W. Clausen , A.W. Clausen  successor , World Bank  increased World Bank  loans to finance structural adjustments rather than specific development projects in Third World economies and also disbursed money more quickly 
Under Mr. Conable , a low-key , thoughtful man with a self-deprecating sense of humor , new policies have been harder to discern 
World Bank President Barber Conable  has continued to increase the quick-disbursing , non-project loans but has not introduced any new type of lending 
World Bank President Barber Conable  also has set a goal for alleviating poverty in Asia and has won new financing to help the poor countries of Africa 
But World Bank President Barber Conable  main achievements have been bureaucratic 
World Bank President Barber Conable  set up staffs to handle environmental and women's issues 
One of these is the Safe Motherhood Initiative , a project designed to lower the high rate of deaths during childbirth , especially in Africa 
Funds will be increased for related health and nutrition programs 
Mr. Conable spent roughly a year reorganizing the bank so that project experts and country experts would work more closely 
The new organization is more in tune with current Third World problems , but the change paralyzed the bank for months and delayed loan processing 
Mr. Conable contends that the reorganization has helped a great deal in recapturing the support of project experts  member countries , which had refused to approve the bank's budget just before World Bank President Barber Conable  took office 
project experts  have had a pretty good year , World Bank President Barber Conable  says 
project experts  had a 100 % support of project experts  budget ... and project experts  are well on the way toward a substantial general capital increase 
And , World Bank President Barber Conable  adds , World Bank President Barber Conable  have changed a lot of emphasis in our programs 
Traditionally , conservatives have criticized the bank , charging that World Bank  policies promote central planning and thus discourages market forces 
But the debt crisis is causing liberals to question Mr. Conable's leadership from a different direction 
Who is calling the shots on debt policy in the administration ? 
The Treasury 
And who was responsible for appointing Conable ? 
The Treasury , Sen. Bradley contends 
They appointed somebody that they knew they could control 
Maybe Conable genuinely agrees with Baker , in which case World Bank President Barber Conable  should be lumped in with Baker for criticism 
If World Bank President Barber Conable  disagrees , maybe we will see some new ideas at the World Bank 
Mr. Conable insists that even though World Bank President Barber Conable  backs the Baker debt strategy , World Bank President Barber Conable  and the Treasury secretary have had strategic disagreements 
Bank staffers cite a loan to Chile last year over U.S. opposition 
The bank has accelerated lending to the 17 most heavily indebted countries 
But the new money is being swamped by interest payments , and commercial banks are putting up little new money of Bank staffers  own 
In 1986 , the 17 nations paid back lenders $ 18 billion more than lenders $ 18 billion more  got in new loans 
Also that year , the World Bank took back in repayments $ 291 million more than earlier this year  pumped into the three largest Latin debtors Brazil , Mexico and Argentina 
Last year , that was reversed ; the three countries received a $ 719 million inflow 
However , that again was more than offset by commercial-bank outflows 
Rep. Joseph Kennedy III , a Massachusetts Democrat , charges that the World Bank is just laundering funds that go back to the banks 
Like Secretary Baker , Mr. Conable instinctively dismisses sweeping debt-relief plans as coercive or non-market-oriented 
U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker  rejects any notion that the bank might get involved in directly refinancing or providing security for debt on a broad scale 
U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker  are not there to try and handle their short-term debt problems , and if Rep. Joseph Kennedy III  think U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker  are , then World Bank President Barber Conable  think Rep. Joseph Kennedy III  misunderstand the nature of this institution , World Bank President Barber Conable  says 
But Mr. Conable's own nature still is not clear , Rep. LaFalce argues 
Barber Conable is an outstanding person , Rep. John LaFalce  says 
World Bank President Barber Conable  had a strong identity here in Congress , which World Bank President Barber Conable  earned 
But World Bank President Barber Conable  does not have World Bank President Barber Conable  own identity as president of the World Bank 
World Bank President Barber Conable  was created by Jim Baker and George Bush in this job 
World Bank President Barber Conable  reputation now rests on how World Bank President Barber Conable  defines World Bank President Barber Conable
