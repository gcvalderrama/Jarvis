The new year ushers in a new wildfire season , an unwelcome thought to the residents of this small Montana tourist town on the northeastern corner of Yellowstone National Park 
For two months last summer the citizens of Cooke City and its tiny suburb , Silver Gate , were showcased on the nightly TV news and splashed across the front pages of the nation's newspapers as forest fires threatened to burn the citizens of Cooke City and its tiny suburb  out 
Pinched between the Storm Creek and Clover-Mist blazes , an estimated 150 seasonal residents and dozens of tourists were evacuated twice while hundreds of firefighters faced down walls of flame which threatened annihilation 
Eventually , millions of dollars , thousands of man hours , and an early autumn snowfall saved the towns 
No structures were lost within the townsboundaries , but seven residences and five outbuildings were destroyed in the area 
One wag even changed the sign leading into town by adding a single letter , rechristening it Cooked City 
Their economically critical summer tourist season a bust and the hunting season crippled , the folks of Silver Gate and Cooke City straggled home in mid-September to pick up the pieces 
The first thing most people around here did was go on vacation , said Patti Smith , owner with her husband , Bob , of the Bearclaw Service and Cabins , a gas station and small motel 
The fire really took a toll on a lot of folks 
Business was way down this fall because the folks of Silver Gate  did not have the hunters , but the folks of Silver Gate  got a lot of curious weekenders from Cody and Billings who wanted to see how bad a lot of curious weekenders  was 
The Smiths , who own the only photocopy machine for 30 miles in every direction , found the folks of Silver Gate  small gas station and convenience store a mecca during the fires 
The U.S. Forest Service , which coordinated some of its firefighting efforts from Cooke City , set up shop near the photocopy machine , and everybody who had information or was seeking some crammed into the Smithslog cabin office 
U.S. Forest Service  was crazy for a while , said Mrs. Smith , 33 
We got sent out twice 
The first time Mrs. Smith , 33  grabbed all the photo albums but forgot our wedding pictures 
The second time the sirens went off and we had to leave , Mrs. Smith , 33  parents had just arrived from North Platte , Neb. , so we all went to Red Lodge (Mont. ), got nice motel rooms , and crashed 
Winter now cloaks Cooke City and Silver Gate , and only about 70 year-round residents remain to weather the below-zero months 
The only grocery store is on The only grocery store  winter schedule , open just Friday through Monday , and many curio shops are shut up tight , but the Bearclaw cabins and most of the other motels are open for winter sports enthusiasts 
Although postmistress Vicky Menuey keeps the office open five days a week , mail only arrives to ZIP code 59020 from the outside world on Mondays , Wednesdays , and Fridays 
Nearly four feet of snow has piled up against the Smithscabins and that is just the way The Smiths  like it , exulted Mrs. Smith 
No smoke , no flames , and plenty of tourists 
No smoke  is snowmobiling season now , and clubs from as far away as Canada and Illinois are booked into Cooke City's motels to take advantage of the beautiful scenery and 80 miles of trails in the area 
The state pays Bob Smith , 34 , to groom the trails 
Because of the heavy day use , Smith works mostly at night in subzero temperatures 
His wife keeps track of Mrs. Smith , 33  by walkie-talkie 
Patti Smith relishes the winter months because His wife  gets caught up on chores , chats with His wife  neighbors and watches videos 
The hottest tape in Cooke City this winter is Three Men and a Baby , for which there is a waiting list 
This winter , Mrs. Smith also has a new project 
Three Men  am going to do Three Men  scrapbooks , Three Men  said , hauling out from underneath a counter a huge cardboard box overflowing with newspaper clippings and official fire bulletins , among them a firefightersnewsletter , The Griz Gazette , purporting to have spotted Elvis Presley on the fire line 
the amateur historian  have got the whole story right here in this box , said the amateur historian 
Of course , a lot of the whole story right  is wrong 
Like nearly everybody else in Cooke City and Silver Gate , Mrs. Smith says nearly everybody else in Cooke City and Silver Gate  never wants to go through another summer like the last one 
Nationwide , it was the second worst wildfire season since the government started keeping records 
Although the 5.9 million acres burned in 1988 did not match the 28 million acres destroyed in 1926 , the $ 583.8 million spent to fight 75,000 fires set a record 
Because of the unprecedented fire season which burned nearly 1.5 million acres in the greater Yellowstone ecosystem , including 705,000 acres within the national park , Mrs. Smith and nearly everybody else in Cooke City and Silver Gate  friends and neighbors worry about what is happening underneath the blanket of snow this winter 
Are there still smoldering embers out there deep in the roots of the trees ? 
wondered Mrs. Smith 
Could the fires survive the winter and pick up and come at Mrs. Smith , 33  again ? 
Park officials and fire experts have asked Park officials  the same questions 
Rod Norum , a fire behavior analyst with the National Park Service , said Rod Norum  would not be surprised if pockets of fire are found in the greater Yellowstone area come spring 
National Park Service  is not the sort of thing to be concerned about , National Park Service  would only be a matter of curiosity and interest because the fires are still under suppression orders and Park officials  would be mopped up and put out immediately , Rod Norum  am sure , said Norum , who is based at the Boise Interagency Fire Center in Idaho 
In Rod Norum  18 years of studying wildfires , Norum has come across several incidents where wildfires buried Park officials  in the roots of trees and grasses and smoldered all winter only to pop up through the snow in the spring 
When the snow melts in May , the Yellowstone country will provide an answer to a question troubling lots of people whose lives were changed by the wildfires of 88
