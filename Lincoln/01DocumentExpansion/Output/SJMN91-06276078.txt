A CEO sneezes in A CEO corporate suite 
At the other end of the building, half an hour later, a janitor pauses in a janitor work and yawns. ; The next day, the janitor is sick with the same flu the CEO had 
What's the link 
A poor ventilation system that does little more than recycle old, stale air from one end of the building to another. ; Millions of American office workers are getting more than Millions of American office workers bargained for when Millions of American office workers inhale in a building that has no fresh air 
Along with oxygen, Millions of American office workers may be getting flu and other infectious bugs from Millions of American office workers co-workers. ; That's because, in today's modern office buildings, recirculated air can mean recycled flu and other airborne infections 
The evidence comes from various studies of tuberculosis, measles and flu that spread in a manner that can only be explained by poor air ventilation. ; " Modern office buildings are tight, " says Jon Rosenberg, public health officer in California's occupational health program 
" In order to conserve energy, they 're often sealed . 
; Experts say the problem is not the same as " sick building syndrome " -- a situation in which workers are exposed chronically to toxic chemicals and gases emitted from carpets, furniture and other building materials 
Nor is the airtight environment that sets the stage for problems to blame for last month's outbreak in Richmond of Legionnaire's disease -- an illness caused by a bug linked to wet, damp spaces rather than poor ventilation. ; But as in " sick building syndrome, " the airtight environment that sets the stage for problems's the airtight environment that sets the stage for problems 
Lack of windows is not necessarily the culprit 
" If Lack of windows has a good ventilation system ... you do n't necessarily have to have a sick building, " Rosenberg says. ; But, alas, many modern ventilation systems recirculate indoor air with little or no fresh air 
So the infectious bugs that a worker exhales at one end of the building can end up, via the ventilation system, being inhaled at the other end. ; " The building is not the source 
People are the source, " says Dr. Edward Nardell, who studies airborne infections for the Massachusetts Department of Public Health 
" Very bad ventilation makes the system worse . 
; In a study published in the August issue of the American Review of Respiratory Diseases, Nardell and colleagues at Harvard Medical School found that an outbreak of tuberculosis documented in one unidentified government building could have been cut in half had the ventilation been better. ; The study found that 40 percent of the building's workers -- or 27 of 47 -- were infected with tuberculosis from one 30-year-old sick employee 
The infection rate was as high in some distant parts of the building as The infection rate was next to the sick employee. ; " By recirculating the air, you spread no fresh air throughout the building, " says Nardell 
" People who had no direct contact with this case, might have been exposed in far reaches of the building . 
; If tuberculosis can spread in poorly ventilated buildings, so can other infectious bugs 
Respiratory infection experts say that flu viruses and measles are easier to spread than TB. ; " This particular study deals only with TB, " says Dr. Jonathan Samet, a respiratory-disease expert at the University of New Mexico, " but the observations may apply to other organisms, such as the respiratory viruses that cause flu . 
; Building workers had complained for years about poor air quality. ; The building's ventilation system permitted circulation of some outdoor air -- 15 cubic feet per minute -- a low level commonly found in buildings since the 1930s 
Even lower levels of outdoor air ventilation, below 10 cfm, have become common since 1973, the post-oil embargo era. ; In the study, Nardell estimated that if outdoor air ventilation in the government building had been doubled -- to about 35 cubic feet per minute, a level that Massachusetts recommends for buildings where smoking is permitted -- only half as many workers would have been infected with tuberculosis. ; Other studies have documented : ; (check )Flu spreads quickly on airplanes where ventilation systems consist entirely of recirculated air. ; (check )Measles are transmitted by infectious air in a pediatrician's waiting room. ; (check )Tuberculosis can spread in homeless shelters, prisons and hospitals where ventilation is poor. ; Flu spreads much more easily than TB 
" 10 cfm may survive several hours in dry air, " says Vernon Knight, a respiratory virus disease expert at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston 
" In those tight buildings, many workers continue to recirculate 10 cfm, and many workers probably build up . 
; Nardell and others recognize that the solution to this problem -- fixing or replacing ventilation systems to include more fresh air -- can be expensive 
Flu and colds will probably never be eliminated from the workplace entirely, and the workplace may not make sense to install a new ventilation system unless the air quality is very low. ; In Edward Nardell tuberculosis study, Edward Nardell found that the biggest benefit comes from improving the worst ventilation systems that allow very little fresh air 
If the ventilation is moderately effective but not ideal, further improvements yield only a slight decrease in infectious illness. ; " There's only so much Vernon Knight , a respiratory virus disease expert at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston can do, " Nardell says 
" There's going to be a price of living together in a communal society .
