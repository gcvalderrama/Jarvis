A grand jury 's questioning of a polygraph expert who is helping investigate the bombing of Pan AM Flight 103 indicates the Justice Department 's probe is entering a new phase . 
A federal grand jury in Washington heard testimony last Friday from James Keefe , a polygraph expert for a security consulting firm hired by lawyers representing Pan Am in a civil suit over the Dec. 21 , 1988 bombing . 
Keefe testified about giving polygraph tests to three Pan Am baggage handlers in Frankfurt , West Germany , during [his(PRP$)| James Keefe(NNP)] appearance before the grand jury , said a source familiar with the case . 
Keefe told the panel two of the three baggage handlers failed the polygraph tests when [they(PRP)| the baggage handlers(NNS)] said [they(PRP)| the baggage handlers(NNS)] knew nothing about the transfer of a piece of luggage to Flight 103 , said the source , who spoke on the condition of anonymity . 
The source confirmed a report published in Tuesday 's editions of the Syracuse Post Standard . 
Keefe 's appearance before the grand jury indicates U.S. authorities are stepping up [their(PRP$)| U.S. authorities(NNS)] investigation of the bombing over Lockerbie , Scotland that killed 259 passengers and crew members and 11 people on the ground . 
Anti-terrorism laws give federal prosecutors in Washington jurisdiction to bring cases in acts that occur abroad . 
Scottish police believe the bomb was in a suitcase that was placed aboard Pan Am Flight 103 in Frankfurt before [it(PRP)| the bomb(NN)] took off for London . 
Passengers and luggage were transferred to a Boeing 747 at London 's Heathrow Airport for the trans-Atlantic leg of the trip to New York City . 
The suitcase is believed to have been brought to Frankfurt aboard a plane from Malta . 
Investigators found clothing fragments in Lockerbie that were traced to a clothing store in Malta , according to a federal law enforcement source . 
The bombing investigation has focused on a number of terrorist organizations , including the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command . 
Polygraph tests can not be admitted in court , but the questions Keefe asked the baggage handlers and [their(PRP$)| the baggage handlers(NNS)] responses may provide investigators with new leads in the case . 
Keefe works for Interfor Inc. , a New York-based security consulting firm retained by lawyers representing Pan Am 's insurance carrier in a $ 300 million damage suit filed by relatives of people killed in the bombing . 
[He(PRP)| James Keefe(NNP)] was served with the grand jury subpoena on Jan. 25 as [he(PRP)| James Keefe(NNP)] stepped off a plane at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York following [his(PRP$)| James Keefe(NNP)] return from Europe , said the source .
