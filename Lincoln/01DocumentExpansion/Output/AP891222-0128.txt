A prosecutor calls it `` witchcraft '' and a psychologist says it 's as reliable as a coin toss . 
After years of debate , court rulings and federal legislation , use of the polygraph has dropped sharply , despite supporters who insist the test is a good indicator of whether someone is telling a lie . 
`` [They(PRP)| supporters who insist the test is a good indicator of whether someone is telling a lie(NNS)] have been useless and give misleading information , '' said Leonard Saxe , a visiting professor of psychology at Brandeis University and a leading opponent of polygraph testing . 
`` [They(PRP)| supporters who insist the test is a good indicator of whether someone is telling a lie(NNS)] suggest whether you 're guilty or innocent . 
You might as well flip a coin . '' 
Last week , the state Supreme Court banned lie detector tests from being introduced as evidence in criminal trials . 
Massachusetts had been one of the last remaining states that gave defendants the right to use polygraphs to support [their(PRP$)| polygraphs(NNS)] alibis . 
The court , noting polygraph studies have shown success rates varying from 95 percent to just above 50 percent , said : `` There remains no consensus among experts as to the accuracy of polygraph testing to detect deceit . '' 
The court was not alone in deciding against polygraphs , which attempt to determine someone 's honesty by [their(PRP$)| polygraphs(NNS)] physiological response to certain questions . 
Last year , Congress prohibited most private sector employers from using lie dectectors to screen job applicants or randomly test workers . 
Exempted from the rules were federal , state and local governments , firms that do sensitive work for agencies like the CIA and FBI , companies that provide security services and those that make or distribute controlled substances . 
`` [I(PRP)| Judy Crockett , who fought on behalf of the federal law for the American Civil Liberties Union(NNP)] think [it(PRP)| CIA(NNP)] 's appropriate to seek if someone is lying , and the most appropriate way is to seek evidence , '' said Judy Crockett , who fought on behalf of the federal law for the American Civil Liberties Union . 
`` Polygraphs tend to be an attempt to short-cut investigations . '' 
The federal law , which took effect a year ago , has taken a big bite out of the polygraph business . 
`` There 's been a definite decline in the private sector , '' said Chris Fausett , product manager for Lafayette Instrument Co. , based in Lafayette , Ind. , one of the country 's largest makers of polygraph machines . 
[He(PRP)| Chris Fausett(NNP)] declined to give specific numbers , but [he(PRP)| Chris Fausett(NNP)] said the drop was `` about as sharp as you can get . '' 
`` No doubt businesses have had to abandon 75-80 percent of polygraph tests , '' said Joseph Buckley , a spokesman for the American Polygraph Association , a trade group based in Chattanooga , Tenn. . 
Buckley said [his(PRP$)| Joseph Buckley(NNP)] group had about 3,000 members a year ago , but the number has dropped by a third . 
`` A lot of [them(PRP)| 3,000 members a year ago(NNS)] had to change careers , '' [he(PRP)| Joseph Buckley(NNP)] said . 
However , these trends do not mean polygraph testing is dead . 
Law enforcement agencies use lie detectors to interview witnesses when investigating crimes . 
The Department of Defense uses polygraph testing to search for spies , and also to screen job applicants if something suspicious arises in background checks , said spokesman Jim Turner . 
Reading from a Defense Department statement regarding the use of polygraphs , Turner said : `` In all instances the polygraph exam process produced data of important security or criminal significance which was not otherwise obtainable . 
[It(PRP)| a Defense Department statement regarding the use of polygraphs(NN)] was also invaluable in establishing the innocence of people confronted with serious accusations . '' 
Many states allow polygraph evidence to be introduced if both the prosecution and defense agree . 
New Mexico is the one state where either party can introduce a polygraph examination as evidence , with the trial judge deciding whether the tests meet certain standards . 
But not everyone in the state supports [it(PRP)| New Mexico(NNP)] . 
Timothy Cornish , a prosecutor in the New Mexico attorney general 's office , called polygraph exams `` witchcraft . '' 
`` [It(PRP)| the New Mexico attorney general 's office(NN)] can , if used in an unbridled way , change the entire truth-seeking process , '' [he(PRP)| Timothy Cornish(NNP)] said . 
`` [It(PRP)| the New Mexico attorney general 's office(NN)] replaces the jury . '' 
David Raskin , a University of Utah psychologist often called upon to support polygraphs in the courtroom , said [he(PRP)| David Raskin(NNP)] favored the federal law because lie detectors were being misused to predict future performance in the workplace . 
But [he(PRP)| David Raskin(NNP)] said [they(PRP)| polygraphs(NNS)] are reliable tools in determining someone 's past actions . 
`` Every piece of evidence has a dose of uncertainty , '' Raskin said . 
`` Jurors are very cautious with polygraph evidence . 
[They(PRP)| polygraphs(NNS)] are overly skeptical . 
[They(PRP)| polygraphs(NNS)] do not ignore other evidence and concentrate on the polygraph . ''
