LONDON A shadow is falling across the light at the British end of the Channel Tunnel 
Just as prospects brighten for the beleaguered chunnel , Britain risks failing to take full advantage of the cross-channel link 
The Thatcher government's announcement yesterday that The Thatcher government's  would not help fund a high-speed rail link between London and the tunnel has fueled fears that the country's creaky transportation system will isolate Britain on the periphery of Europe 
Sarah Talbot-Williams , a spokeswoman for the Confederation of British Industry , Britain's main employersgroup says , 1992 is going to produce a much more competitive market 
If Britain's main employers do not have the infrastructure to get the goods to Europe , Britain's main employers will continue Britain's main employers status as an island 
Long plagued by soaring costs and drilling delays , the tunnel now looks set to open on time in June 1993 
British diggers , who once lagged months behind schedule , currently are just one week behind ; British diggers  French counterparts are running three months ahead of plan 
And although the project's estimated cost has soared to # 7.66 billion ($ 13.11 billion )from # 4.9 billion , tunnel executives have obtained underwriting for an equity rights offer and preliminary agreement for more bank loans to cover the added cost 
There will be no more talk of crisis , says Alastair Morton , chief executive officer of Eurotunnel PLC , the consortium building the cross-channel link 
The money will be together this year , and the project will be clear from there 
But the lack of a high-speed rail link to London , and improved service beyond , means Britain may miss out on the tunnel's total benefits 
There is a danger of not being able to exploit the tunnel to the tunnel  full potential , says Prof. Christopher Nash , a transport expert at Leeds University in Northern England 
The government's refusal to help fund a fast rail service between London and the tunnel terminal at Folkestone culminates an 18-month squabble 
European Rail Link Ltd. , a consortium formed last November to build the rail link , had asked the government to contribute # 350 million towards the total # 2.6 billion cost of the link 
Transport Secretary Cecil Parkinson told the House of Commons that the consortium's plans involved unacceptable risks for taxpayers 
Transport Secretary Cecil Parkinson  said British Rail , which owns 50 % of the consortium , would consider other options for a fast-rail link 
But no one expects a viable scheme anytime soon 
Defending the decision , Mrs. Thatcher earlier told Parliament that the government already had earmarked almost # 2 billion for chunnel-related projects , including # 600 million on roads leading to the tunnel and # 1.3 billion in passenger and freight rail services 
But that did not satisfy opposition legislators 
Britain will enter the 21st century with an inadequate 19th-century railway link , said John Prescott , the Labour Party's transportation spokesman 
As a result of Thursday's decision , the journey time to London from Paris will be about three hours 30 minutes longer than with a high-speed rail link 
Passengers boarding high-speed trains in Paris will zoom at 180 miles an hour north to Calais , slow to 100 miles an hour through the tunnel , then crawl at an average of 60 miles an hour across southeast England's crowded commuter belt 
The traffic will now speed through as far as Passengers boarding high-speed trains in Paris  side of the tunnel , and then the men with red flags will lead The traffic  on to London , complains Keith Speed , a Conservative member of Parliament whose constituency is near the tunnel terminal 
Eurotunnel insists the tunnel will be financially viable without the high-speed rail link 
The tunnel-building consortium argues that only 39 % of The tunnel-building consortium  total revenue will come from direct London-to-Paris trains ; the real money-spinner will be freight traffic hauled by road to the tunnel , then loaded onto special Eurotunnel wagons for the journey under the channel 
Passengers boarding high-speed trains in Paris  make more money on road traffic using Passengers boarding high-speed trains in Paris  tunnel , Mr. Morton says 
There is in no sense a feeling Passengers boarding high-speed trains in Paris  must have that link to make the tunnel successful 
But Mr. Morton admits Alastair Morton  wants to see the high-speed link built , professing the high-speed link built  would divert traffic from southeast England's clogged roads 
The high-speed link will be a benefit for Passengers boarding high-speed trains in Paris  , Alastair Morton  says , but essential for the country 
Some analysts go further , arguing the tunnel indeed needs better rail links if the tunnel  is to compete with improving ferry and air services 
A high-speed link which covers -LCB- only -RCB- part of the route proves to be fairly uncompetitive with other transportation modes , says Bill Steinmetz , vice president of transport for consultants Booz-Allen & Hamilton Inc. in London 
If you are going to build high-speed rail , you have to decide how to provide complete links 
A high-speed link which covers -LCB- only -RCB- part of the route  is like having part of a house built 
A high-speed link which covers -LCB- only -RCB- part of the route  may function , but you do worry about A high-speed link which covers -LCB- only -RCB- part of the route  
The worries do not end in London 
North of the capital , industrialists fear poor railway links will isolate industrialists  on the fringes of the European Community's single market 
The Channel Tunnel is a marvelous addition to the infrastructure , says David Merrill , corporate-affairs director at Pilkington PLC , the big glass maker based in St. Helens in Northwest England 
But the Channel Tunnel  is important that the quality of the rail network and capacity is improved 
David Merrill  do not think there is any time to lose
