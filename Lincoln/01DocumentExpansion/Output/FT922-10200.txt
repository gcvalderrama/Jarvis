LOS ANGELES Police Chief Daryl Gates had been accused of nurturing one of the most brutal police forces in the country : now LOS ANGELES Police Chief Daryl Gates  is under attack for fuelling the violence and then standing by as the violence  rolled across poor black neighbourhoods 
Mr Gates acknowledged yesterday that Mr Gates  department had been overwhelmed by the scale of the violence 
Police could only look on , outnumbered , as crowds looted shops , and moved in mostly to protect firefighters from attack 
The controversial police chief was said to have argued on Wednesday , the first night of rioting , against sending in National Guard troops , and only to have bowed later to evidence that The controversial police chief  police force was incapable of handling the violence 
That the Los Angeles police department should have been overwhelmed by the riots may be understandable , but the Los Angeles police department  represents one final blot on Mr Gates's reputation 
In Mr Gates  14 years of office , Mr Gates  critics say Mr Gates  has built a heavily politicised force in Mr Gates  own image : aggressive , insensitive and widely tinged with racism 
Shortly after Mr Gates  appointment in 1978 , Mr Gates told a Hispanic audience that Hispanic officers were not promoted because Hispanic officers  were lazy , and Mr Gates  later suggested that the carotid choke hold - a police technique severely curbed in 1983 after police had killed 16 suspects with it - might be more dangerous for blacks because the police  arteries did not open up as fast as on normal people
In March , Mr Gates strongly defended the detective who had led an investigation 17 years earlier into the killing of an off-duty Los Angeles police officer , although a judge had just released the two men wrongfully convicted , calling police conduct reprehensible and urging an immediate investigation of the sordid record 
The detective involved now heads the unit which investigates shootings involving police officers 
But the Los Angeles police chief has almost complete protection from removal under a 1937 statute that followed a series of political scandals , and Mr Gates has developed political clout on top of this job security 
President George Bush last year called Mr Gates an exemplary police chief , although at the time President George Bush last year  called the conduct of the four Los Angeles officers - whose acquittal this week over the beating of a black motorist triggered this week's protests and violence - sickening and outrageous 
A high-ranking commission appointed after the beating , under the chairmanship of Mr Warren Christopher , a lawyer and former deputy secretary of state , concluded that the Los Angeles police department got results , in terms of arrests , but had developed a siege mentality that alienates the officer from the community 
Besides recommending that Mr Gates should go , the Christopher commission urged a policy of community policing with more foot patrols , as well as measures to discipline racist police officers and to improve the investigation of complaints about police brutality 
The commission found that a significant minority of the Los Angeles police force repetitively misuse force without being properly disciplined 
Six months after A high-ranking commission appointed after the beating , under the chairmanship of Mr Warren Christopher  initial report , however , the commission noted that of the 44 officers identified as the object of six or more brutality complaints , two had been fired , three had resigned and 11 removed from field duty 
Mr Gates has finally agreed to step down in June 
Mr Gates  replacement , Mr Willie Williams , will be the first black head of the Los Angeles force 
Mr Williams faces an uphill struggle , but Mr Willie Williams  has drawn widespread praise as Philadelphia's police commissioner since 1988 for mending fences between the police and the community - notably through the use of the foot patrol methods recommended by the Christopher commission
