A major earthquake registering 7.1 on the Richter scale struck off northeastern Honshu Island early today , officials said . 
Three coastal villages were ordered evacuated for fear of tidal waves , officials said . 
There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage from the quake , which struck at 3:26 a.m. Thursday -LRB- 1:26 p.m. Wednesday EST -RRB- . 
[It(PRP)| the quake(NN)] was centered about 60 miles off the coast and at a depth of 20 miles , the Central Meteorological Agency in Tokyo said . 
After the quake , officials closed the major expressway through the affected region for inspection and overnight trains were stopped to check the condition of the rails . 
The agency warned of a tsunami , or seismic tidal wave , hitting coastal towns on northeast Honshu and the northernmost main island of Hokkaido . 
The agency said sea levels two hours after the quake had risen nearly three feet in the region . 
Officials ordered the evacuation of the villages of Taro , Sanriku and Ozutsu , about 300 miles northeast of Tokyo on Honshu 's eastern coast . 
The agency said the quake had a magnitude of 7.1 on the Richter scale , the same as the Oct. 17 earthquake that devastated the San Francisco Bay area . 
In Washington , the U.S. Geological Survey said the quake measured 7.3 on the Richter scale . 
U.S. Geological Survey scientists said [they(PRP)| U.S. Geological Survey scientists(NNS)] recorded an aftershock measuring 5.8 about 10 minutes after the main quake . 
The main earthquake was the strongest in that region in more than 58 years , since a magnitude 7.7 earthquake March 9 , 1931 , said Don Finley , a spokesman for the U.S. agency . 
The earthquake occurred in the same general area as a series of earlier tremors during the past several weeks . 
The strongest of the earlier quakes was a magnitude 6.5 on Sunday . 
The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs . 
Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude . 
Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times stronger than one of 6.5 . 
An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight damage in the local area , 4 moderate damage , 5 considerable damage , 6 severe damage . 
A 7 reading is a `` major '' earthquake , capable of widespread heavy damage ; 8 is a `` great '' quake , capable of tremendous damage . 
Japan is situated on a major fault line that produces frequent earthquakes , few of which cause serious damage .
