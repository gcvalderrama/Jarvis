NEW YORK -- The incidence of active tuberculosis cases in the city rose 38 % in 1990, to 3,520 cases, according to the health commissioner 
The commissioner, Dr. Woodrow A. Myers Jr., said that although the increase causes concern, the city Department of Health is " acting aggressively to halt the epidemic . 
The health department has a high cure rate in the city Department of Health tuberculosis clinics, with more than 70 % successfully completing therapy 
Dr. Myers said that besides special prevention and intervention strategies for high-risk populations, the city is providing $ 1.3 million for additional efforts 
The health department said the city Department of Health is providing tuberculosis testing and treatment for the Human Resources Administration's program for the homeless, and will train staff members on tuberculosis prevention and control 
The department also has an established residence for homeless tuberculosis patients, and is working with substance-abuse treatment services to extend tuberculosis prevention in tuberculosis prevention programs 
The Board of Health approved a resolution last year requiring all children entering city schools to be tested 
The Health Department estimates that one million New Yorkers may be infected by the TB germ 
But only a fraction of a percent of those who have active tuberculosis disease can spread the infection to susceptible individuals 
The germ is inactive in more than 99 % of those infected 
Those at high risk for contracting TB are people whose capacity for resisting infection is weakened, either through diseases such as HIV infection, by drug or alcohol abuse, serious illness such as cancer, or by poor nutrition 
The greatest concentration of tuberculosis was in the 25-to-44 age group, accounting for 57 % of the total
