As they scanned the flow of passengers at Los Angeles International Airport, police detective Clayton Searle and his fellow narcotics officer searched for the likely companion of the suspected drug courier who stood handcuffed nearby 
When Searle noticed a short, muscular black man walk toward them and then turn abruptly toward a bank of telephones, the plainclothes Los Angeles police detective moved in quickly to question Morgan , Searle 
Within minutes, however, their words had turned into violence, and the two men toppled to the terminal floor where Searle handcuffed Morgan , Searle suspect and pulled Morgan , Searle to Morgan , Searle feet 
Placing Morgan , Searle hand across the man's mouth, the officer then marched Morgan , Searle away before a gathering crowd of gaping passersby 
Only later did Searle and his partner from the Drug Enforcement Administration realize that the suspected drug courier Searle and his partner from the Drug Enforcement Administration had arrested on that March day in 1988 was Joe Morgan, the former Cincinnati Reds second baseman who was inducted Monday into Major League baseball's Hall of Fame 
The 46-year-old Morgan, who is now an Oakland businessman and baseball broadcaster, is suing Searle and the city of Los Angeles in federal court, claiming that The 46-year-old Morgan , who is now an Oakland businessman and baseball broadcaster was unfairly targeted because The 46-year-old Morgan , who is now an Oakland businessman and baseball broadcaster is black and fit a certain " profile " that narcotics officers think a drug courier should look like 
" There's no doubt in an Oakland businessman and baseball broadcaster mind that the only reason Searle and the city of Los Angeles stopped Joe Morgan was because The 46-year-old Morgan , who is now an Oakland businessman and baseball broadcaster is black and The 46-year-old Morgan , who is now an Oakland businessman and baseball broadcaster was the first black who happened to come by, " said William Barnes, one of the attorneys representing the former ballplayer 
The Morgan case also reflects a growing criticism of police use of the drug courier profile to stem the flow of drugs through airports 
" The Morgan case's purely based on race or dress, not on whether William Barnes , one of the attorneys representing the former ballplayer are involved in any drug activity, " said Gary Trichter, a Houston defense lawyer and former police officer who specializes in such cases 
First developed in the 1970s, the drug courier profile was based on patterns of behavior believed to be used by those who use commercial airline flights to transport narcotics 
Such suspicious behavior include erratic movements, paying for tickets with cash, using an alias, boarding a long flight without luggage and staying briefly in distant cities known to be sources of narcotics 
Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that government agents may stop and question airline passengers who look and act like drug couriers 
But the court said brief detentions must be based on a person's behavior, not just on race or appearance 
" Profiles are important and government agents use airline passengers who look and act like drug couriers, but exactly how government agents use airline passengers who look and act like drug couriers or what the profile is Los Angeles Police Department Cmdr. William Booth can not tell Gary Trichter , a Houston defense lawyer and former police officer who specializes in such cases, " said Los Angeles Police Department Cmdr. William Booth 
" a certain " profile " that narcotics officers think a drug courier should look like is certainly not something based on any prejudice or racism 
a certain " profile " that narcotics officers think a drug courier should look like's based on trying to protect the public . 
Los Angeles Police Department Cmdr. William Booth said that last year, 254 narcotics arrests were made at Los Angeles International Airport 
Through Aug. 
3 of this year, there have been 121 such arrests 
Frank Schults, chief of public affairs for the DEA in Washington, denied that Frank Schults agency uses drug courier profiles 
" We have any number of investigative techniques and ways to identify people involved in moving drugs, but a profile is not one of them, " Frank Schults said 
Neither Booth nor Schults would comment on the Morgan lawsuit, which is scheduled to go to trial for a second time next month in Los Angeles 
Morgan is seeking unspecified damages, claiming that The 46-year-old Morgan , who is now an Oakland businessman and baseball broadcaster civil rights were violated 
Last April, a six-person federal jury rejected Morgan's case 
But two months later, U.S. District Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer set aside the verdict after ruling that U.S. District Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer had failed to instruct jurors that Morgan had been illegally detained by police 
" There is n't any possible other conclusion but that the stop was illegal, " the judge concluded 
Both Searle, a 20-year Police Department veteran, and William Woessner, a DEA agent who was subsequently dropped from the lawsuit, have denied that Both Searle , a 20-year Police Department veteran , and William Woessner did anything wrong 
" Morgan , Searle wish that this had n't happened, " Searle said 
" Morgan , Searle wish (Morgan )luck now that Morgan , Searle know who The 46-year-old Morgan , who is now an Oakland businessman and baseball broadcaster is 
Morgan , Searle just hope Morgan , Searle never see The 46-year-old Morgan , who is now an Oakland businessman and baseball broadcaster again . 
Morgan could not be reached for comment 
But in court documents, The 46-year-old Morgan , who is now an Oakland businessman and baseball broadcaster said that on March 15, 1988, The 46-year-old Morgan , who is now an Oakland businessman and baseball broadcaster was waiting at Los Angeles International Airport for a connecting flight to Tucson to attend a golf tournament and was innocently making a phone call when Searle suddenly grabbed Morgan , Searle shoulder and spun Morgan , Searle around 
Asked to identify The 46-year-old Morgan , who is now an Oakland businessman and baseball broadcaster, Morgan said The 46-year-old Morgan , who is now an Oakland businessman and baseball broadcaster told the officer that his wallet was in an attache case about 40 feet away but that Searle refused to let Morgan , Searle retrieve his wallet 
When a bystander -- who would later testify for Morgan -- recognized the former player and tried to intervene, both men claimed that Searle warned the man to stay away 
Minutes later, Morgan said, Searle grabbed Morgan , Searle by the neck and both men fell to the floor 
Morgan said the officer then put a knee in his fellow narcotics officer back, wrenched his fellow narcotics officer arms behind his fellow narcotics officer and handcuffed his fellow narcotics officer 
The 46-year-old Morgan , who is now an Oakland businessman and baseball broadcaster was taken to a small children's nursery in the terminal and interrogated, but within minutes the officers had confirmed The 46-year-old Morgan , who is now an Oakland businessman and baseball broadcaster identity, Morgan said 
Searle then offered to free Morgan , Searle if Morgan , Searle would forget the matter, according to Morgan's lawsuit 
Instead, Morgan filed The 46-year-old Morgan , who is now an Oakland businessman and baseball broadcaster complaint, in part, to discourage similar incidents from occurring, The 46-year-old Morgan , who is now an Oakland businessman and baseball broadcaster attorneys said 
" This happened to Joe Morgan, but it really is applicable to any black person who uses Los Angeles airport, " said Oakland attorney Edwin Wilson Jr., who also is black 
" If it was n't Joe, this could have happened to Oakland attorney Edwin Wilson Jr. , who also is black or Oakland attorney Edwin Wilson Jr. , who also is black father or to any other black person . 
Searle, 42, denied the allegations but told The Times Morgan , Searle could not discuss specifics of the case 
" All Morgan , Searle can say is that the guy is a great baseball player and appears to be a good announcer, " Searle said 
" Morgan , Searle wish it did n't happen 
the guy just sort of went out of control . 
Assistant City Atty. Honey A. Lewis, who represents the officer and the Police Department, said Searle had acted properly and was merely asking Morgan to identify The 46-year-old Morgan , who is now an Oakland businessman and baseball broadcaster when Morgan suddenly became belligerent, spewing profanities and slapping the officer 
" Honey A. Lewis argument is that Mr. Morgan overreacted, " Lewis said 
" If Morgan , Searle had cooperated, none of this would have happened 
Honey A. Lewis think Morgan , Searle had a bruised ego, and Morgan , Searle was offended because the officer had n't recognized the officer had n't . 
According to Searle's sworn court deposition, the incident began after he and Woessner, working together as members of an airport anti-drug task force, had arrested a passenger as a suspected drug courier 
They said Morgan , Searle was using an alias 
Although the officers found no drugs in Morgan , Searle possession, Searle said narcotics officers discovered that the passenger was holding a second plane ticket, and narcotics officers began looking for Morgan , Searle companion 
Since the passenger was black and indicated that a passenger companion " looked like the likely companion of the suspected drug courier who stood handcuffed nearby, " the officer began looking for a black man who was nervous-looking or having " other characteristics of a narcotics courier . 
When narcotics officers spotted Morgan, Searle said, Morgan , Searle tried to speak to Morgan , Searle but Morgan started screaming profanities and " making animal noises " and hit Morgan , Searle in the chest with a wild swing 
In Morgan , Searle suit, Morgan denies that and contends that Morgan , Searle suffered " acute physical and emotional distress and embarrassment " after the incident and expressed concern about damage to Morgan , Searle reputation
