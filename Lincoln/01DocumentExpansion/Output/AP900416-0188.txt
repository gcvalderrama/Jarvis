John Hatch , founder of the non-profit Foundation for International Community Assistance , promotes village banking to encourage private enterprise in the Third World 
What John Hatch  foresees is a body blow to world poverty through bootstrap economics 
John Hatch says John Hatch  hit upon John Hatch  Third World poverty vaccination while panic-stricken on a flight to Bolivia 
John Hatch  had decided John Hatch  could not comply with requirements of a consulting job John Hatch  had accepted from the Agency for International Development , and John Hatch  was scrambling to come up with a suitable substitute 
And on my second double bourbon at 35,000 feet up flying over the Andes , John Hatch  have to say my second double bourbon  was like this thought just rolled through John Hatch  body , Hatch recalls 
John Hatch  had John Hatch  calculator out and John Hatch  was sketching this thing and John Hatch  was doing numbers , and John Hatch  arrived in La Paz with a full-blown concept 
What John Hatch  had stumbled upon was village banking , a system of investment using small revolving loans to poor women to finance poor women  private enterprise , allowing poor women  to create savings while paying interest and qualifying for bigger loans 
The series of loans , starting at $ 50 , is renewable over three years to a ceiling of $ 300 , allowing recipients to reach a level at which recipients  can qualify for commercial credit 
What Hatch envisioned on that plane five years ago has translated into 400 village banks in nine countries with more than 35,000 members 
Portfolios total $ 1.6 million , with a 96 percent repayment rate 
Village banks are operating in Mexico , Haiti , Thailand , Guatemala , Honduras , Costa Rica , Bolivia , Peru and El Salvador 
The concept is similar to the one behind the Grameen Bank of Bangladesh : channeling money to the impoverished , principally mothers , without the demands of commercial banks for collateral , so they can improve their familieslives 
What Hatch foresees is a body blow to world poverty through bootstrap economics 
Hatch , a one-time Peace Corps volunteer with a doctorate in economic development , is founder and president of the non-profit Foundation for International Community Assistance , which recently moved its headquarters from Tucson to Alexandria , Va. 
John Hatch  says Peace Corps  impetus was , and remains , the thousands of children worldwide who die daily because of starvation , what John Hatch  calls the sacrifice of probably founder and president of the non-profit Foundation for International Community Assistance , which recently moved its headquarters from Tucson to Alexandria , Va.  most precious resource 
Hatch focuses on reaching mothers in the belief that strengthening mothers  economically lets mothers  care for their children better 
There is almost a 100 percent guarantee that increased income for women will go into improvements in poor women  children's welfare , Hatch says 
poor women  teach severely poor mothers how to create their children  own self-managed bank , which provides their children  with self-employment loans , provides their children  with savings incentives and provides their children  with a support group of mothers like their children  , so that their children  are all attacking change at the same time 
Lawrence Yanovitch , small enterprise development program coordinator for Catholic Relief Services in Baltimore , Md. , says , John Hatch is close to the voice of the poor 
Though John Hatch  is come up with some sophisticated economic tools , John Hatch  is kept the humanitarianism 
Catholic Relief Services entered a five-year , $ 1 million joint venture a year ago with the U.S. Agency for International Development and the foundation to create 40 village banks in Thailand 
They targeted microenterprise development through small entrepreneurs , vendors , village market women , who in some developing countries comprise up to 50 percent of the employment 
Capitalization for one bank typically will cost a sponsoring agency $ 5,000 
Beryl Rupp , a Rotary Club official in Phoenix , says the bank members buy necessities with the bank members  profits or savings : a chair to sit on , pots to cook in , blankets , better food 
The women , when asked , speak of the greatest benefit in terms of what Hatch calls empowerment perceptions 
village market women  say things like , Now John Hatch  am somebody , or John Hatch  husband respects John Hatch  more 
village market women  vehicle for improvement is the village bank , each comprised of 30 to 50 women who , through loans starting at $ 50 , can earn enough to provide savings and create capital 
Hatch says the loans give village market women  freedom to start village market women  own investment projects in or near home 
The foundation will go into a village with a joint-venture partner that puts up at least half of the capitalization , such as Rotary Clubs or Catholic Relief Services , and identify a key woman 
a joint-venture partner that puts up at least half of the capitalization  then contacts others to attend an organizing meeting 
Forget the mayor , forget the priest , forget the chief , Hatch says 
contacts others  want to know who the most powerful woman is in that village 
At the meeting , the women circle illustrated examples of quick-turnover work contacts others  want the loans to finance 
an organizing meeting  might be selling produce , groceries , baked goods , raising chickens , sewing or craftwork 
Each woman signs her name or provides a thumbprint as collateral , agreeing to repay one-sixteenth of the loan weekly , plus interest of 1 percent to 3 percent , in line with local banks 
In some countries , the repayment rate has been 100 percent 
Overall , the average is 97 percent , says Hatch 
Fifty percent or more are illiterate , and John Hatch  would say 90 percent of one-sixteenth of the loan weekly , plus interest of 1 percent  do not have any idea of what one-sixteenth of the loan weekly , plus interest of 1 percent  are getting into when we start out , says Hatch 
And yet within 16 weeks one-sixteenth of the loan weekly , plus interest of 1 percent  are all experts 
one-sixteenth of the loan weekly , plus interest of 1 percent  just learn as one-sixteenth of the loan weekly , plus interest of 1 percent  go 
Women who join the bank screen members and elect the bank screen members  leaders from first-meeting attendees 
At the end of the 16th week , each member's loan balance is zero 
But at the same time , each woman has been depositing weekly savings of at least 20 percent of the original loan 
The savings serve as incentive for subsequent loans by increasing the credit line each time , Hatch said 
Interest in village banking is mounting 
The United Nations has provided a $ 50,000 grant to research the effects of women's empowerment through village banking on maternal and child health practices 
The foundation has major proposals pending with the Agency for International Development , the Ford Foundation , Citibank and the Chase Manhattan Bank , among others 
Rotary Club 100 , a Phoenix organization , and a Rotary Club of Mexico City are in a joint venture , having funded five village banks in Guaymas , Mexico , with another four to be launched in the slums of Mexico City 
Hatch says John Hatch  believes village banking has a role to play in reducing poverty along the Mexican border and in slowing down migration to this country 
As for whether such a system could work in the United States , Rotary's Rupp says , Frankly , such a system  is the only hope others  have of changing the welfare system 
Ultimately the way out of poverty is savings , Hatch adds 
the way out of poverty  is got to be built on the back of others  own savings
