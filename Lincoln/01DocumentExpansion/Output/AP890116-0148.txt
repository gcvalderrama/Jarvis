Natural gas explosions that leveled two homes and damaged a third in two days were called a coincidence by utility officials , but some residents remain unconvinced . 
Northern Illinois Gas Co. crews reported finding nothing unusual Monday while scouring more than 100 homes and a school within a mile radius of the explosions Thursday and Saturday in this town of 17,000 about 60 miles northwest of Chicago . 
`` [It(PRP)| Northern Illinois Gas Co.(NNP)] 's just a coincidence .

Fire Chief Richard Nebel said [it(PRP)| Fire Chief Richard Nebel(NN)] will probably take investigators weeks to determine the causes of the blasts . 
`` The leaks we know of have been stopped , '' Nebel said late Monday . 
`` We are taking test bores and no leaks or vapors have been found today . ''

On Thursday , James Steurer , 79 , was sitting on [his(PRP$)| James Steurer(NNP)] bed tying [his(PRP$)| James Steurer(NNP)] shoes when a gas explosion leveled [his(PRP$)| James Steurer(NNP)] house and sent [him(PRP)| James Steurer(NNP)] and the mattress flying into the driveway . 
[He(PRP)| James Steurer(NNP)] suffered only cuts and scratches , noting `` absolutely , [I(PRP)| James Steurer(NNP)] 'm lucky . ''
