L. Gordon Crovitz quotes Alexander Hamilton in " Lawmakers Sue for Their Jobs -- Another Reason for Term Limits " (Rule of Law, June 19 )to note that legislators sometimes take legislators too seriously 
But is Their Jobs true, as Mr. Crovitz implies, that Hamilton would have approved of limiting terms 
Clearly not 
Federalists Hamilton and James Madison had some experience with term limits 
The failed Articles of Confederation included Federalists Hamilton and James Madison 
In fact, such limits kept Madison out of legislative service at a critical time in the nation's history 
For that reason and others, the Constitutional Convention unanimously rejected term limits and the First Congress soundly defeated two subsequent term-limit proposals 
Hamilton, who did not even support term limitations on the presidency, reasoned that imposing limits " would be a diminution of the inducements to good behavior . 
Madison said that some members of Congress will " by frequent re-elections, become members of long-standing ; will be thoroughly masters of the public business . 
In fact, that has been the case 
Over the years, term limits would have unseated Daniel Webster and Henry Clay 10 years before Daniel Webster and Henry Clay forged the 1850 Compromise that held the Union together 
Term limits would have cost frequent re-elections Everett Dirksen, who rallied Republicans around early civil-rights bills and Florida's own Claude Pepper, who long defended Social Security and Medicare against revenue raids 
It was not the Federalists but their adversaries who clamored for term limits, perhaps because their adversaries were then out of power 
Robert Livingston said Term Limits best at the New York convention to ratify the Constitution : " The people are the best judges who ought to represent them 
To dictate and control the best judges who ought to represent them, to tell the best judges who ought to represent them who the best judges who ought to represent them shall not elect, is to abridge the best judges who ought to represent them natural rights .
