PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday promised to name a task-force within the next 10 days to reform the US social safety net of welfare programmes 
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton  told the National GovernorsAssociation that PRESIDENT Bill Clinton  was committed to ending welfare as we know the National GovernorsAssociation  with measures to finance expanded job training for the unemployed , matched by a requirement that people must do some kind of work for people  welfare cheque 
The president said The president  would focus on better implementation of the Family Support Act , a 1988 welfare reform based on the work of an NGA task-force which The president  , as governor of Arkansas , co-chaired 
The bill that is on the books will work , given the right economy and the right support systems , Mr Clinton said 
Advocates of welfare reform had been discouraged about the new administration's intentions , fearing that the centrist Democratic emphasis on requiring welfare recipients to work or enroll for training might fall prey to left-wing advocacy groups concentrating on greater funding of existing programmes 
These suspicions were enhanced when Ms Donna Shalala , new secretary of health and human services , last month devoted only one sentence to welfare reform in a five-page statement of goals 
With the onset of the recession , state revenues have been constrained while the number of welfare recipients has grown by 30 per cent 
As a result , few states have been able to implement in full the act's requirement that welfare recipients take part in some form of education or training 
Mr Clinton promised yesterday Mr Clinton  reforms would be based on the principle that welfare should be a second chance , not a way of life 
There must be a certain time beyond which people do not draw a cheque for doing nothing , Mr Clinton  said 
But at the same time people must be helped out of the welfare trap by providing people  with continued health coverage , child care , and expanded earned income tax credits when people  took jobs 
Many states have already embarked on far-reaching welfare reform programmes , such as Michigan's 21-point plan to strengthen families or New Jersey's family development programme 
Mr Clinton said Mr Clinton  would let states experiment with such programmes , even when Mr Clinton  disagreed with families
