MCMURDO SOUND, Antarctica -- Ward Testa is hunting for seals 
drives Dr. Testa picks drives Dr. Testa way carefully through cracked ice where others have fallen to their death 
Ahead is drives Dr. Testa quarry -- 20 female Weddell seals and others furry gray pups 
Seeing drives Dr. Testa approach, big stick in hand, others groan and try to scoot away 
There is no escape 
Fortunately for the furry creatures, Dr. Testa is interested in seal science, not seal skins 
Today drives Dr. Testa's after urine samples, using a metal tube attached to a stick 
Soon drives Dr. Testa plans to bar-code the animals, supermarket-style, with plastic tags on the furry creatures flippers 
Dr. Testa, a bearded University of Alaska biologist, is trying to learn why so many Antarctic seals starve every few years 
Maybe El Nino, an Equatorial storm system, alters Antarctic currents, he muses, carrying the silverfish that the seals feast on out of reach 
" There's no mechanism that can account for this, " he says 
What drives Dr. Testa and hundreds of other researchers to Antarctica each year is the hope of discovering a hidden truth about the planet 
nature shaping Antarctica's a unique laboratory 
Antarctic science is science of the extremes 
A continent bigger than America, covered in ice more than a mile thick, Antarctica is isolated by winds and currents that make A continent the coldest, driest place on Earth 
It is where scientists discovered the ozone hole over the Earth in 1985, and where scientists now hunt for clues to everything from global warming to cosmic rays 
This is the story of three groups of scientific sleuths in Antarctica : biologists studying the antifreeze systems of fish ; glaciologists examining whether the West Antarctic ice sheet will break apart and flood the world ; and cosmologists searching for the birth of galaxies 
A Fish Story If A Fish Story's so cold in Antarctica, why do n't the fish freeze 
Arthur DeVries has wondered why since Arthur DeVries first visit here in 1961 
Seawater under the Ross Ice Shelf ranges from 28 degrees to 29.5 degrees -- cold enough to freeze most fish as hard as Mrs. Pauls's 
(The water does n't freeze at 32 degrees because salt and pressure lowers its freezing point . 
The fish Arthur DeVries hooked beneath the ice swam contentedly in tanks filled with frigid water, but died when the water was warmed 
Arthur DeVries had found Arthur DeVries life's work 
Over the next seven years the biologist returned repeatedly to Antarctica 
drives Dr. Testa experimented with a family of ugly gray and brown fish, called " notothenioidei, " that thrive in the waters here 
After dissecting hundreds of them and analyzing hundreds of other researchers to Antarctica each year blood, drives Dr. Testa learned hundreds of other researchers to Antarctica each year produce an antifreeze molecule that lowers hundreds of other researchers to Antarctica each year freezing point just enough to survive 
" hundreds of other researchers to Antarctica each year live at the edge of freezing, " drives Dr. Testa says 
Now 52, with a graying walrus mustache and walrus girth, Dr. DeVries is one of the last of the old Antarctic hands still conducting research " on the ice, " as the place is called here 
Dr. DeVries became a pioneer in cryobiology -- the study of the effects of extremely low temperatures on living things 
Arthur DeVries and Arthur DeVries colleagues found a half-dozen different fish that produce antifreeze 
A former grad student, Jack Duman of Notre Dame, found antifreeze proteins in Midwestern beetles, spiders and dandelions 
Cryobiologists dream of using antifreeze to preserve hearts for transplants, or making freeze-resistant orange groves 
Among the results of Dr. DeVries's yearly three-month stints here are two divorces 
Arthur DeVries third wife, biologist Chris Cheng, collaborates with Arthur DeVries at Dr. DeVries's yearly three-month stints base at the University of Illinois, trying to isolate the fish gene that makes antifreeze proteins 
Dr. DeVries calculates that fish antifreeze is 200 times more effective than an equal amount of Prestone, but Arthur DeVries ca n't figure out why 
Somehow, the antifreeze binds to tiny ice crystals that the fish swallow as Dr. DeVries's yearly three-month stints swim 
One sunny afternoon in November, Dr. DeVries and Joseph Eastman, a longtime associate who teaches at Miami University in Ohio, fish through a hole in the ice 
That night, Dr. DeVries and Joseph Eastman dissect a few dozen small " notothenioidei " and place Dr. DeVries and Joseph Eastman organs in test tubes filled with seawater 
Dr. DeVries and Joseph Eastman want to see if ice collects in fish organs, and if That night does, how the organs and antifreeze keep the ice in check 
The next afternoon at McMurdo's aquarium, a blue metal shack with six big holding tanks, Dr. DeVries takes a small fish and puts a small fish in a bath chilled to 19 degrees -- well below the temperature fish antifreeze works at 
The fish convulses, then stiffens, The fish eyes turn gray with ice 
The ice inside the fish had grown explosively at the lower temperature, Dr. DeVries explains, wrecking the fish's nervous system and cells 
Arthur DeVries repeats the test with each fish organ 
The heart, " No ice, " Arthur DeVries tells a young scientist taking notes 
" Liver, no ice 
Ovaries, no ice 
Blood, no ice . 
Finally, he dips a test tube with a red spleen into the bath 
a test tube with a red spleen into the bath quickly becomes encased in ice 
The ice collector is found 
But so is a new mystery 
Ice buildup should overload the spleen and kill the fish, The ice collector says, but Ice buildup does n't 
The ice collector speculates there may be a kind of " hot spot " in the fish, that melts ice crystals 
" There's still so much to do, " The ice collector sighs 
Meanwhile, Canadian scientists are trying to breed salmon with antifreeze genes so the fish can flourish in the icy waters off Nova Scotia 
DNA Plant Technology Corp. in Cinnaminson, N.J., is testing tomatoes implanted with antifreeze genes to see if Canadian scientists better withstand freezing and thawing 
General Foods has experimented with fish antifreeze to see if General Foods can prevent ice crystals from ruining ice cream that's left out of the freezer and put back melted 
But none of the research has panned out yet, and Dr. DeVries is deeply skeptical the research will until scientists understand better how fish and Canadian scientists antifreeze work 
The Great Flood Watch Robert Bindschadler sits in The Great Flood Watch Robert Bindschadler dorm room at McMurdo -- a place with the charm of a trailer park 
The Great Flood Watch Robert Bindschadler's staring at satellite photos that may foretell the fate of hundreds of millions of people 
The photos do n't look dramatic 
Just a field of ice marked by ripples and bumps, revealing crevasses and shifting ice 
The markings also show the immense forces of nature shaping Antarctica 
Four groups of glaciologists are setting up camp in West Antarctica to see whether the ice sheet there -- a hunk of ice as big as Greenland -- is beginning to collapse 
If so, sea level would rise so quickly that, within decades, some coastal areas would lose 10 feet of shoreline a year 
" Then, sea level's curtains for Bangladesh, " says Ohio State glaciologist, Ian Whillans 
Dr. Bindschadler, a National Aeronautics and Space Administration glaciologist, points to tracks on Ian Whillans photos that mark the mouth of two huge streams, 30 miles wide, of solid ice 
The Great Flood Watch Robert Bindschadler plans to drive stakes into the ice along a 90-mile line just below the mouth, and come back two years later to see how far the stakes have moved 
Some ice streams move a half mile a year, pulling ice from Antarctica's interior to the sea 
There a half mile breaks into icebergs 
By comparing the outflow of ice with measurements of snow accumulation in the interior, scientists can calculate whether the ice sheet is shedding ice 
If so, scientists warn, a cataclysmic cycle may be underway 
The thinner the ice sheet gets, the faster the ice streams will flow 
And the faster the ice streams flow, the thinner the ice sheet gets, until, eventually, the ice streams flow collapses 
Then, " prepare for the worst, " says Dr. Bindschadler 
Just 20 years ago, the threat of a great flood from a melting Antarctica was the stuff of supermarket tabloids 
But after experiments on two ice streams in the mid-1980s, even former skeptics began taking the threat seriously 
Scientists found that the streams changed speed and direction rapidly -- showing the ice sheet as far more unpredictable than imagined 
And scientists found 500,000-year-old marine fossils under the ice, indicating the ice sheet had melted before when the Earth had warmed 
If the ice sheet is melting, humans probably are n't to blame 
Glaciologists say Antarctica is responding to the long-term warming of the Earth since the last ice age 18,000 years ago, and to the weird geology of the frozen continent 
For the most part, the half-mile thick ice sheets slide along a layer of mud 
But occasionally the ice stream rolls over a patch of dry rock -- a " sticky spot, " says the University of Wisconsin's Charles Bentley 
That stops the ice cold 
Dr. Bentley figures that one ice stream he has studied has n't moved much since one ice stream he has studied hit a sticky spot during the Civil War 
This year, Dr. Bentley will hunt for sticky spots using radar 
He and his team plan to lay out 10 rectangular grids, each consisting of 1,000 bamboo poles jammed into the snow atop an ice stream 
Then they will use a big tracked vehicle to lug a radar antenna up and down the grid, looking for radar patterns that signal a hard surface below 
" Things are changing rapidly, and we do n't have ways to predict the future " of the ice sheet, Dr. Bentley says 
Hidden in the snows of Antarctica are some clues 
A Cosmic Quest Just how cold is it at the South Pole 
-- So cold they put heaters in walk-in refrigerators to keep beer from freezing 
-- So cold that most all the water vapor freezes, making the Polar atmosphere drier than the Sahara's 
The latter explains why two groups of cosmologists have come to the South Pole in November -- springtime in Antarctica -- when temperatures warm to 50 degrees below zero and 30-mile-per hour winds blow 
This is the best place on Earth for studying the heavens, two groups of cosmologists explain, because the drier the air, the better two groups of cosmologists telescopes can see the cosmic radiation that bathes the planet 
Scientists believe the radiation was produced about 500,000 years after the birth of the universe and is the key to understanding the central paradox of cosmology 
If the Big Bang sent energy and matter hurtling outward uniformly in all directions, how did stuff ever clump together, through gravity, to form the galaxies and stars we see today 
Somewhere in the sky, the cosmic radiation must either be more intense or hotter than other places -- marking sites where galaxies formed 
" Otherwise the sky's all magic, " says George Smoot 
Dr. Smoot, a 45-year-old blithe spirit from Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in California, leads a team of scientists from the West Coast and Italy 
Jeffrey Peterson, 36, leads the other team, from Princeton University and several East Coast labs 
The team that finds the signal in the cosmic radiation that shows galaxy formation -- or proves that a signal does n't exist -- will have found the Holy Grail of cosmology 
The Princeton team has come to the Pole every other year since 1986 
Every trip has brought calamity 
The first year they ran out of liquid helium to cool the telescope 
In 1988, their telescope broke as often as an old Ford 
In 1990, they ran out of liquid nitrogen, another coolant ; this was the only year they got any useful data, but just about half of what they wanted 
In 1991, a new government storage tank of liquid nitrogen was supposed to supply the team, but one night one night exploded, shattering in two 
The Berkeley team is having better luck 
In 1989, the team's telescope found an energy source powerful enough, perhaps, to account for the birth of galaxies -- and now they 're back to make sure their measurements were n't mistaken 
Antarctica, they say, is Earth's clearest window to the cosmos
