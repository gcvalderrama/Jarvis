Even the scientists came to cross-purposes in designing this little world . 
Botanists wanted wind for pollination . 
Entomologists did not want [their(PRP$)| Entomologists(NNS)] bugs sucked up by big fans . 
The people in the middle were the engineers , constantly revising plans , compromising . 
It is the professional nature of engineers and architects to keep the outside world out . 
Now suddenly [they(PRP)| engineers and architects(NNS)] had to devise ways to keep the wild world in . 
As for the scientists , [they(PRP)| Even the scientists(NNS)] were used to having the whole outdoors as a laboratory . 
Now [they(PRP)| Even the scientists(NNS)] have to be satisfied with a very confined indoors . 
Consider hummingbirds , great little pollinators . 
But a pair of hummingbirds need the nectar of 3,200 flowers a day for energy . 
Scientists had to be sure there would be that many in bloom every day of the year . 
At the outset , no one thought what would happen to the airtight bubble with the air heating up and expanding during the day . 
[It(PRP)| the outset(NN)] would explode the glass . 
So the engineers devised external , inflatable lungs that would store the excess until [it(PRP)| the excess(NN)] cooled for return to the biosphere . 
With a closed water supply , engineers also had to devise exterior tanks to cool the liquid . 
In short , this small world in some cases is too small for [its(PRP$)| this small world in some cases(NN)] own good . 
Nevertheless [it(PRP)| this small world in some cases(NN)] will be the same air and water year-round . 
The oxygen is breathed in by humans and animals who breathe out carbon dioxide which is breathed in by the plants and used in photosynthesis which produces more oxygen . 
Biosphere II is built on a hill to take advantage of the natural proclivity of water . 
A stream begins on an 85-foot mountain that dominates the rain forest . 
[It(PRP)| A stream(NN)] then flows through the plains and grasslands of the savanna , down to the 25-foot deep ocean with [its(PRP$)| A stream(NN)] coral reef and then to the salt and freshwater marshes , drying up before [it(PRP)| A stream(NN)] reaches the desert . 
The water-laden air then is drawn and climbs the mountain where natural cooling and condensing coils bring [it(PRP)| The water-laden air(NN)] down as rain and dew to feed the stream again . 
The desert required a compromise . 
There was no way to reduce the humidity . 
So Dr. Tony Burgess of the University of Arizona patterned the deserts after those of Baja California where the cactus and other plants have learned to live with ocean fog . 
Perhaps the most difficult design was Dr. Walter Addey 's for the salt and freshwater marshes . 
[He(PRP)| Dr. Walter Addey 's for the salt and freshwater marshes(NNP)] built prototypes , one in the basement of the Smithsonian Institution where [he(PRP)| Dr. Walter Addey 's for the salt and freshwater marshes(NNP)] is director of the Marine Systems Laboratory , and another in a greenhouse of Washington 's Old Soldiers Home . 
The problem was the proximity of the fresh and saltwater species . 
The result is a miniature Florida Everglades . 
`` The marsh may have been one of the most fragile of the systems because of the life that lives in the mud , '' explains Kathy Dyhr . 
`` But in the prototypes he found they had virtually no species extinctions except for the mosquitoes , to which everyone raised a cheer . 
But Walter said that 's not so great because we need them for the fish . 
So they put up signs that said do n't swat the mosquitoes . '' 
In a world without chemicals , the biosphere settlers will rely on ladybugs , lacewings , marigolds and crop rotation to control pests . 
Human and animal waste and compost becomes fertilizer . 
`` The earth has [its(PRP$)| Earth(NNP)] problems , '' says Carl Hodges of the University of Arizona who designed the human habitat . 
`` [We(PRP)| the biosphere settlers(NNS)] 've got acid rain problems , dirty air problems , and [we(PRP)| the biosphere settlers(NNS)] 've got carbon dioxide increasing at an alarming rate . 
Right now [we(PRP)| the biosphere settlers(NNS)] do n't have a research tool where [we(PRP)| the biosphere settlers(NNS)] can control the global parameters , like CO2 and the quality of the atmosphere . 
[I(PRP)| Carl Hodges of the University of Arizona who designed the human habitat(NNP)] see the big payoff of Biosphere II as learning how to do a better job of stewardship of Biosphere I. '' The rain forest and [its(PRP$)| the rain forest(NN)] towering mountain and stream are the design of Dr. Ghillean Prance , director of the Kew Royal Botanical Gardens of London in association with the New York Botanical Garden . 
[He(PRP)| Carl Hodges of the University of Arizona who designed the human habitat(NNP)] patterned [it(PRP)| the big payoff of Biosphere II(NN)] after the dwindling rain forests of the Amazon . 
Dr. Peter Warshall of the University of Arizona patterned the savanna grasslands after those of South America , Australia and Africa . 
Plants and animals from those areas create the grasslands in Biosphere II . 
In all , some 3,800 species of plant and animal life are being invited to the party , and as in the original Eden , snakes . 
Says Dyhr , `` We may need a python in there , if we put in rodents which help aerate the soil and carry seeds . '' 
There will be no large predators , however . 
Not enough room . 
An ocelot needs two acres to range for food . 
There might be some mouse deer to help eat the grasses . 
Of almost as much interest as the individual biomes are the ecotones or tension areas where one biome yields reluctantly to the next . 
In these areas , where well-defined habitats change , scientists hope to learn how desert encroaches on more productive areas , what happens when fresh water turns brackish , what goes on when climates change . 
The idea of a biosphere , a living creation of nature with its own logic , its own rules , is not new . 
Probably the first to consider Earth and its environment as a biosphere was a Soviet scientist , V.I. Vernadsky , in 1926 . 
The idea was further developed by James Lovelock and Lynn Margolis , who postulated , after Darwin , that the environment helps mediate species variation . 
In the beginning , or near [it(PRP)| the beginning(NN)] , [they(PRP)| James Lovelock and Lynn Margolis(NNP)] suggested that oxygen was sparse and so most of the early creatures were anaerobic bacteria that did n't need oxygen . 
But [they(PRP)| James Lovelock and Lynn Margolis(NNP)] gave off oxygen , and in the process poisoned [their(PRP$)| James Lovelock and Lynn Margolis(NNP)] own environment so [they(PRP)| James Lovelock and Lynn Margolis(NNP)] had to retreat into the mud . 
Biosphere II may teach mankind enough so [it(PRP)| Biosphere II(NNP)] does not suffer the same fate .
