If this had been another issue , liberal Sen. Howard Metzenbaum and conservative Sen. James McClure might have quietly hammered out differences between their rival bills to make certain that plastic pistols ca n't get through airport metal detectors . 
But history has taught that a gun control engagement is never fought with silencers , even in rare instances like this one , when rival sponsors have identical goals : stopping terrorists , especially at airports . 
So once again , bitter enemies of past gun control struggles are following the usual rules of engagement _ high-powered lobbying , full-page advertisements , fund-raising appeals and doomsday rhetoric . 
Sparking the latest debate is a weapon not even on the market . 
Red Eye Arms of Winter Park , Fla. says [it(PRP)| Winter Park(NNP)] has a patent for plastic weapons , but wo n't start making handguns for at least two years _ and then only for military and police use . 
`` [We(PRP)| bitter enemies of past gun control struggles(NNS)] would never allow anyone to build an undetectable civilian handgun , '' said company vice president Dwight Brunoehler . 
Metzenbaum , D-Ohio , and McClure , R-Idaho , have vastly different approaches to require that the guns be made detectable . 
Both would ban manufacture or importation of any guns that did not meet their standards . 
Metzenbaum 's bill would require a minimum weight of metal to ensure that an alarm would be triggered at today 's magnetometer settings . 
[Its(PRP$)| Metzenbaum 's bill(NN)] target is not only future plastic guns , but pint-size metal pistols that are not detected today . 
The federal Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms estimates there are three small metal guns that could get through most magnetometers now used . 
The gun owners ' lobby estimates there are countless other models . 
McClure 's legislation targets plastic guns only , and has no minimum metallic requirement . 
However , [it(PRP)| no minimum metallic requirement(NN)] would require that guns be detectable , by either including some metal , a serial number engraved or stamped on metal , or a substance detectable by X-ray machines used for luggage . 
Using today 's technology , McClure 's bill would require more sensitive magnetometer settings , more alarms , and therefore more airport passenger inconvenience _ some say gridlock . 
Brunoehler , of Red Eye Arms , says [his(PRP$)| company vice president Dwight Brunoehler(NNP)] firm has developed a computer chip for plastic guns that would make the lower settings unnecessary . 
The chip would emit a signal that would make [it(PRP)| a computer chip(NN)] appear that an enormous amount of metal was passing through the machine , [he(PRP)| company vice president Dwight Brunoehler(NNP)] said . 
Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Fred Farrar said the FAA is aware of the chip , but believes [it(PRP)| Federal Aviation Administration(NNP)] could be disabled by drilling a hole in [it(PRP)| Federal Aviation Administration(NNP)] or even placing the weapon in a microwave oven . 
While these are the technical points for debate , a congressional gun fight often ranges far beyond the issues at hand and this one is no exception . 
The principal gun owner 's lobby , the National Rifle Association , told [its(PRP$)| the National Rifle Association(NNP)] 2.8 million members in a fund-raising letter last year that Metzenbaum 's real goal is `` the first federal gun ban bill in America . '' 
`` If Sen. Metzenbaum 's bill passes , the next thing will be some government official knocking at your door to weigh your guns for inspection , '' said the NRA , which backs the McClure bill . 
To Handgun Control Inc. , the most visible lobby for pistol regulation , the issue is what the group calls the NRA 's extremism . 
`` Cop-killer bullets , mail-order handguns , machine guns ... has the NRA gone off the deep end ? '' 
says HCI ads , which have different police chiefs using those same words . 
Handgun Control supports Metzenbaum . 
So do a dozen law enforcement organizations . 
`` Both sides are simply waving flags so believers will send money to Handgun Control Inc. and to the National Rifle Association , '' says John Aquilino , a former NRA official who now publishes [his(PRP$)| John Aquilino(NNP)] own gun owners ' newsletter . 
`` [They(PRP)| believers(NNS)] 're making advertising agencies very wealthy . 
[It(PRP)| Handgun Control Inc.(NNP)] 's flag-waving and fund-raising . '' 
The latest battle reflects new political realities that surfaced in 1986 . 
Then , the major law enforcement organizations joined forces with handgun control advocates to fight NRA-backed legislation to ease many restrictions of the 1968 Gun Control Act . 
The presence of uniformed policemen lobbying [their(PRP$)| the major law enforcement organizations(NNS)] local lawmakers began to neutralize some of the NRA 's seemingly invincible clout . 
Nonetheless , the gun lobby attained many of [its(PRP$)| the National Rifle Association(NNP)] goals two years ago with passage of the McClure-Volkmer Act , which changed a number of provisions of the 1968 law . 
But the invigorated gun control-police alliance was able to retain , as part of that fight , a ban on interstate sales of handguns . 
Now , the same coalition of police and gun control advocates is back on the detectability question . 
But Jerald R. Vaughn , executive director of the International Association of Chiefs of Police , says of his fellow police lobbyists , `` [We(PRP)| his fellow police lobbyists(NNS)] 're still babes in the woods when [it(PRP)| International Association of Chiefs of Police(NNP)] comes to the political process . '' 
Yet , the NRA has taken an unusual turn by backing McClure 's bill . 
The group normally opposes any legislation that could bring more restrictions on firearms . 
Only last May , NRA Governmental Affairs Director James Jay Baker told a House panel , `` The NRA believes that the only workable approach '' to the detection problem is better security at airports . 
[He(PRP)| NRA Governmental Affairs Director James Jay Baker(NNP)] said `` attempts to dictate metallic content of firearms or chemical composition of non-metallic components of firearms '' were unnecessary . 
`` Their position from day one has been , there shall never be any law on guns , '' said N.T. `` Pete '' Shields , chairman of Handgun Control Inc. . 
`` All of a sudden this issue of plastic handguns has made them compromise this whole concept . 
[I(PRP)| N.T. `` Pete '' Shields , chairman of Handgun Control Inc.(NNP)] think they have come a long way , but [I(PRP)| N.T. `` Pete '' Shields , chairman of Handgun Control Inc.(NNP)] think they 're trying to address [it(PRP)| a long way(NN)] with smoke . 
McClure 's bill is impractical . 
You would bottle up the airport . '' 
Baker said in an interview , `` The NRA has moved a long way on this issue . 
We decided to take the bull by the horns and deal with the terms as framed by the other side . 
If they 're interested in detectability , [it(PRP)| the bull(NN)] can be done with no interference with existing firearms . '' 
Metzenbaum 's most prominent Senate ally is Strom Thurmond , a conservative South Carolina Republican and ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee . 
Metzenbaum and Thurmond tried to win passage of their legislation last December , but [it(PRP)| passage of their legislation(NN)] was tabled by a 47-42 vote . 
Metzenbaum , in an interview , called McClure 's bill `` purely cosmetic . '' 
McClure , also in an interview , said [he(PRP)| conservative Sen. James McClure(NNP)] rejects any arbitrary metallic standard , and called any potential inconvenience `` part of the price you pay for having secure airports . ''
