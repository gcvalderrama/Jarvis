Federal officials delayed closing a troubled Colorado savings and loan largely because President Bush 's son was on [its(PRP$)| Colorado(NNP)] board , a former federal bank regulator charged in a published report Wednesday . 
`` Neil Bush 's presence was a material part of unconscionable delays in taking over Silverado , '' James Moroney told the San Francisco Chronicle . 
Moroney is a former staff analyst for the Topeka Federal Home Loan Bank , which supervised Silverado Savings and Loan of Denver . 
The head of the Topeka bank at the time denied that Neil Bush 's presence was an influence . 
`` The economic substance of Silverado 's loan portfolio was comparable to a Ponzi scheme -LRB- a type of pyramid investment fraud -RRB- , and [it(PRP)| The economic substance of Silverado 's loan portfolio(NN)] could n't have worked out , '' said Moroney , 42 , a Kansas City lawyer who left the Topeka bank after six months in 1986 . 
`` [It(PRP)| The economic substance of Silverado 's loan portfolio(NN)] was insolvent back -LRB- in 1986 -RRB- . 
[It(PRP)| The economic substance of Silverado 's loan portfolio(NN)] was not a judgment call . 
That place , clearly , was very insolvent , '' Moroney said . 
Neil Bush resigned from Silverado 's board just after [his(PRP$)| Neil Bush 's(NNP)] father won the Republican nomination in 1988 and only four months before the S&L 's seizure . 
The Chronicle also reported that documents [it(PRP)| the San Francisco Chronicle(NNP)] obtained show top federal regulators knew the thrift 's financial situation was bad enough to mandate restrictions on investments and insider deals at least 14 months before [it(PRP)| at least 14 months(NNS)] was closed Dec. 9 , 1988 . 
Moroney said [he(PRP)| James Moroney(NNP)] believes a big reason his district superiors , including former Topeka bank president Kermit Mowbray , allowed Silverado to continue was [their(PRP$)| his district superiors(NNS)] knowledge that Neil Bush and Republican Party fund raiser Larry Mizel , of MDC Holdings , were involved with the institution . 
Mowbray , who retired the month that Silverado closed , denied Moroney 's allegations Tuesday , saying : `` Neil Bush being on that board had no effect on [our(PRP$)| his district superiors(NNS)] decisions . '' 
Mowbray , who said [he(PRP)| Kermit Mowbray(NNP)] never met Bush , also denied knowing that Silverado was insolvent in 1986 . 
In 1986 , Moroney said [he(PRP)| James Moroney(NNP)] approached a fellow supervisor and asked : `` Why are [we(PRP)| his district superiors(NNS)] putting up with this Silverado ? 
[We(PRP)| his district superiors(NNS)] would not permit that type of loan work-out for another institution . '' 
`` And [he(PRP)| a fellow supervisor(NN)] looked at [me(PRP)| James Moroney(NNP)] , and said , ` Well , you know who one of the directors is . ' 
And [I(PRP)| James Moroney(NNP)] said , ` No . ' 
And [he(PRP)| a fellow supervisor(NN)] said , ` The vice president 's son . 
Neil Bush , '' ' Moroney told the Chronicle . 
However , [he(PRP)| Neil Bush 's(NNP)] said [he(PRP)| Neil Bush 's(NNP)] has no evidence that either Bush or Mizel exerted direct pressure for `` the preferential treatment [they(PRP)| either Bush or Mizel(NNP)] got . '' 
[He(PRP)| Neil Bush 's(NNP)] said [their(PRP$)| either Bush or Mizel(NNP)] presence was enough to cause Mowbray to take an extraordinary interest in Silverado and to proceed cautiously in the case . 
Bush , reached by telephone at [his(PRP$)| Neil Bush 's(NNP)] office in Denver , said , `` [I(PRP)| Neil Bush 's(NNP)] 'm going to cooperate in any way [I(PRP)| Neil Bush 's(NNP)] 'm asked to . 
It would be inappropriate for [me(PRP)| Neil Bush 's(NNP)] to get into any details except with authorities investigating Silverado . '' 
In a news conference Wednesday in Washington , D.C. , President Bush 's spokesman Marlin Fitzwater was asked whether the president was concerned that Silverado 's collapse might have have been partly due to regulators who were `` fearful of Neil Bush 's role . '' 
Fitzwater replied , `` These matters are all under investigation and consideration and [we(PRP)| regulators who were `` fearful of Neil Bush 's role(NNS)] wo n't offer any comment on any aspect of [it(PRP)| a news conference(NN)] . 
[I(PRP)| Marlin Fitzwater(NNP)] might say , Neil 's been off that board for a long time . '' 
President Bush is scheduled to visit Denver on Friday .
