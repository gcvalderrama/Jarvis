Michael Milken , who faces insider trading charges , is seen as the Wall Street whiz kid who made `` junk-bond '' financing into the tool of choice for corporate raiders . 
In so doing , Milken , 42 , transformed Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. from a minor player on Wall Street into a powerhouse and in the process made [himself(PRP)| Michael Robert Milken(NNP)] feared , respected and enormously wealthy . 
The 184-page civil complaint filed in U.S. District Court in New York against Milken , Drexel and others on Wednesday followed months of speculation about Drexel 's involvement in the Ivan Boesky insider trading scandal . 
Although the move by the Securities and Exchange Commission had been anticipated , Milken and others who have made fortunes in junk bonds continued to hold [their(PRP$)| Milken and others who have made fortunes in junk bonds(NNP)] annual Beverly Hills spring gathering known as the Predators ' Ball . 
The message was clear : Never mind the burgeoning government investigation of insider trading . 
[It(PRP)| The message(NN)] was business as usual at Drexel , and Milken was still king of the junk bonds _ high-risk , high-yield notes used to finance corporate takeovers . 
Milken had refused to comment publicly on the scandal up until Wednesday , when [he(PRP)| Michael Robert Milken(NNP)] issued a written statement asserting that `` for the past 22 months [I(PRP)| Michael Robert Milken(NNP)] have been the subject of a shadow trial of systematic leaks and innuendo based on false accusations . '' 
In anticipation of a crisis , Drexel undertook a public-relations campaign starting last year to polish [its(PRP$)| last year(NN)] image , stressing the role of junk bonds in helping small companies and downplaying [their(PRP$)| small companies(NNS)] role in large takeover battles . 
The normally secretive and unreachable Milken [himself(PRP)| Michael Robert Milken(NNP)] played a major role in that blitz , accepting speaking engagements . 
[He(PRP)| Michael Robert Milken(NNP)] granted selective media interviews _ on condition there would be no questions about the Securities and Exchange Commission and the investigation . 
The speeches and interviews focused almost solely on Milken 's latest pet plan _ to alleviate the Latin American debt crisis by swapping debt for equity or selling securities backed by those countries ' oil and silver resources . 
In the years before the insider trading scandal , the financial media wrote glowingly of Milken . 
`` A one-man revolution , '' Forbes magazine headlined one typical article . 
`` A world-class financial wizard , on a plane with the likes of Bernard Baruch and Jay Gould ... Mozart of the money markets , '' wrote California Business magazine . 
[It(PRP)| a relatively short road for Milken(NN)] had been a relatively short road for Milken , from head cheerleader at Birmingham High School in the San Fernando Valley in 1964 _ actress Sally Field and superagent Michael Ovitz were among [his(PRP$)| superagent Michael Ovitz(NNP)] classmates _ to the top of the nation 's financial industry . 
Milken reportedly pulls down $ 40 million a year as the head of Drexel 's junk-bond operation and [his(PRP$)| Michael Robert Milken(NNP)] personal fortune has been estimated at more than $ 500 million . 
[He(PRP)| Michael Robert Milken(NNP)] lives with [his(PRP$)| Michael Robert Milken(NNP)] children and wife , Lori _ [his(PRP$)| Michael Robert Milken(NNP)] high school sweetheart whom [he(PRP)| Michael Robert Milken(NNP)] married at age 22 _ in a house on the former estate of the late actor Clark Gable in suburban Encino , an upper-middle-class section of the San Fernando Valley two miles from [his(PRP$)| Michael Robert Milken(NNP)] childhood home . 
Milken 's fascination with finance stetches back to [his(PRP$)| Michael Robert Milken(NNP)] boyhood . 
At age 10 , while other boys were giggling over comic books , Michael Robert Milken was enamored of money . 
A favorite pastime was hovering over tax returns being prepared by his father , an accountant . 
After studying business at the University of California , Berkeley , and the University of Pennsylvania 's Wharton School , Milken went to work for Drexel Firestone & Co. in Philadelphia as a junior bond trader . 
Drexel merged with Burnham & Co. in 1973 and Lambert Brussels Witter in 1976 to become today 's Drexel Burnham Lambert , and Milken 's job was moved to New York . 
Milken worked hard to make a name for [himself(PRP)| Michael Robert Milken(NNP)] but never got used to the East . 
As the story goes , [he(PRP)| Michael Robert Milken(NNP)] wearied of the cold Eastern winters that froze [his(PRP$)| Michael Robert Milken(NNP)] water pipes and kept [his(PRP$)| Michael Robert Milken(NNP)] two children from playing outside . 
[He(PRP)| Michael Robert Milken(NNP)] also tired of the long commutes from [his(PRP$)| Michael Robert Milken(NNP)] home in suburban Philadelphia to Wall Street . 
In 1977 , [he(PRP)| Michael Robert Milken(NNP)] pulled off a coup by convincing Drexel to let [him(PRP)| Michael Robert Milken(NNP)] move the company 's junk-bond operations from Wall Street to Beverly Hills , just off swank Rodeo Drive . 
[His(PRP$)| Michael Robert Milken(NNP)] reasoning was simple : [He(PRP)| Michael Robert Milken(NNP)] did n't have to be sitting in a tiny office in Manhattan to make deals . 
[He(PRP)| Michael Robert Milken(NNP)] just had to know the players and have [their(PRP$)| the players(NNS)] confidence . 
Milken was enormously successful in that regard , almost single-handedly building a close-knit network of junk-bond investors . 
Milken no longer has to go on the road to make deals . 
The corporate players come to [him(PRP)| Michael Robert Milken(NNP)] . 
Milken still works hard _ 12 to 13 hours a day , seven days a week . 
[He(PRP)| Michael Robert Milken(NNP)] once said [he(PRP)| Michael Robert Milken(NNP)] had no hobbies `` because what [I(PRP)| Michael Robert Milken(NNP)] do is fun . '' 
Milken 's appearance generally is described as ordinary . 
[He(PRP)| Michael Robert Milken(NNP)] buys [his(PRP$)| Michael Robert Milken(NNP)] suits off the rack , and [it(PRP)| the rack(NN)] was only a couple years ago that [he(PRP)| Michael Robert Milken(NNP)] traded in [his(PRP$)| Michael Robert Milken(NNP)] unstylish American car for a Mercedes .
