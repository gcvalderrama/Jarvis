The 80,000 men and women who battle the nation's wildfires have always known The 80,000 men lives were endangered by flames or heat or falling debris 
But now, two new studies show The 80,000 men also face an unseen hazard : Their health is under siege from the poisonous stew of gases and soot in wildfire smoke 
Among the culprits are carbon monoxide, which slows reaction and impairs judgment ; microscopic particles of carbon that lodge in the lungs ; aldehydes and acids that irritate air passages, and hydrocarbon-based substances and other chemicals that can damage genes and cause cancer, tests show 
Wildland firefighters, whose only protection is the cotton bandanna covering Wildland firefighters faces, lose as much as 10 % of their lung capacity after one routine season, and the damage persists for weeks, according to the studies by the California Department of Health Services and the Johns Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health in Baltimore 
Combined, the researchers tested the lungs of more than 100 California wildland firefighters before and after the 1988 and 1989 fire seasons 
Health experts also suspect that exposure to wildfire smoke may accelerate aging, prompt fatal heart attacks or cancer and trigger respiratory diseases such as chronic bronchitis or asthma 
" After fires, Health experts cough up black gunk 
Then, after a week, Health experts think Health experts 're back to normal 
But our studies show Health experts lungs are n't back to normal, " said Dr. Robert Harrison, the California health department's chief of occupational health surveillance and the physician in charge of one of the studies 
" For some of the firefighters, the drop in lung function was rather striking . 
The worst doses of carbon monoxide and other hazardous chemicals, which can be fatal, are given off when fires smolder, the stage in which firefighters spend most of their time, said Darold Ward, a U.S. Forest Service chemist 
Mark Linane, who heads a national firefighting crew known as the Hotshots, said Mark Linane has seen wildland firefighters so poisoned by carbon monoxide that wildland firefighters so poisoned ca n't decide which shoe to tie 
The hazards are particularly acute in Southern California, which is prone to more large, smoky fires than anywhere else in the nation 
Its four-year drought has turned grasslands tinder dry, and Its four-year drought stagnant weather conditions and topography can trap smoke for days 
Furthermore, forestry officials predict that the region's 1990 fire season will be devastating 
The Yosemite fires, which have scorched more than 15,000 acres and are still out of control, and the recent Santa Barbara and Glendale fires, which destroyed nearly 500 homes, are only the largest of hundreds of blazes in the state 
" hundreds of blazes in the state 've got lots of summer ahead of hundreds of blazes in the state and hundreds of blazes in the state 've already burned 600 or 700 structures, " said Deputy Chief Keith Metcalfe of the state's southern regional firefighting crew in Riverside . 
... Because of the dryness, fires are burning more rapidly and more intensely . 
For nearly 10 years, urban firefighters have known that toxic smoke from burning structures and cars greatly increases urban firefighters chances of cancer and heart disease 
The bandannas that once were their only protection were replaced by air tanks and masks long ago 
But the U.S. Forest Service and state and county fire officials have been unable to protect state and county fire officials wildfire crews because state and county fire officials know of no gear light enough for firefighters to wear while hiking miles in burning terrain or effective enough to filter out the wide variety of toxic materials in smoke 
Furthermore, developing protection for the crews has gotten little attention and virtually no state or federal funding 
National fire officials say National fire officials can not get help from Congress unless National fire officials can prove firefighters are dropping dead 
But because no mortality studies have been funded, all National fire officials have is the old joke heard around the fire camp : Just try to find a wildland firefighter still breathing after 60 
" the old joke's a crime that National fire officials continue to let these guys function like this, " said James Johnson, director of hazard control projects at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Northern California, which is developing respiratory gear for its firefighters 
" these guys 're a forgotten group, a hidden subset of people who have been ignored en masse 
In all my 18 years of experience in industrial hygiene, James Johnson 've never seen anything like my 18 years of experience in industrial hygiene . 

In the past, firefighters believed more than 100 California wildland firefighters coughing and congestion were fleeting side effects 
But the new health studies have documented physiological changes in the lungs and airways that do not vanish with the smoke 
The Johns Hopkins tests, conducted on 52 Northern California wildland firefighters during the 1988 season, showed that 52 Northern California wildland firefighters during the 1988 season lung function -- or flow of oxygen -- remained reduced by as much as 3 % even eight weeks after exposure 
The researchers said the researchers have not determined if the lungs heal between seasons or if the damage accumulates 
The California health department's tests on 63 firefighters showed 63 firefighters lost as much as 10 % of 63 firefighters lung capacity during one six-month fire season, with an average loss of 4 % 
For many firefighters, the lung congestion turns into bronchitis or walking pneumonia three times a year, said Linane, 46, who has fought wildfires for 28 years 
" James Johnson take antibiotics and the lung congestion eventually goes away, " Linane said 
" But then the lung congestion comes back 
And more often . 
During the four months of fires in 1988 at Yellowstone National Park, 12,000 firefighters sought medical aid for respiratory problems, and about 600 needed a doctor's care after returning home, a U.S. Forest Service report says 
Stan Stewart, 37, said Stan Stewart knew when Stan Stewart joined the Forest Service at 17 that the job was dangerous 
But Stan Stewart did n't know Stan Stewart would feel sicker and sicker every year 
" The doctor told Stan Stewart Stan Stewart look like Stan Stewart 've smoked 10 packs of cigarettes a day all Stan Stewart life 
But Stan Stewart 've never smoked, " said Stewart, foreman of the Hotshot crew in Los Padres National Forest near Ojai 
" Stan Stewart lungs are probably shot 
Stan Stewart 'm a little more worried every year . 
Health researchers, usually reluctant to interfere in policy decisions, said Health researchers feel strongly enough about the hazard that Health researchers are urging fire officials to provide respiratory protection as soon as possible 
" Health researchers 're not surprised firefighters have decreased lung function 
Health researchers just wanted to document lung function so the firefighting agencies would take action, " said Dr. John Balmes, a pulmonary specialist and occupational health expert at UC San Francisco who helped with the state's study 
Harrison said the forestry agencies and fire departments should at least warn Health researchers crews -- and potential recruits -- of the danger and consider rotating shifts more often to reduce smoke exposure 
Although the findings of the national studies have not yet been published, word has spread to top officials in the state Forestry Department, who say top officials are now starting to search for protection for the agency's 3,500 full-time firefighters and about 2,000 seasonal ones 
" Jack Wiest , the department's chief of fire planning and research do n't want to wait for firefighters to die, " said Jack Wiest, the department's chief of fire planning and research 
" top officials have to get on this right now . 
Part of the solution is to develop lightweight and long-lasting respirators 
Air tanks and masks that are standard for fighting structural fires weigh 40 pounds and last only 15 to 30 minutes, so top officials are impractical for wildfire crews that hike miles carrying as much as 60 pounds of hoses and tools 
Developing technology, however, takes money, and none has been allocated by California forestry officials 
" Respiratory protection for wildland firefighters is non-existent 
And we 're looking at a couple of years, at least, before something is developed, " Wiest said 
Last year, researchers from the U.S. Forest Service and Johns Hopkins asked Congress to fund a $ 13.4-million, four-year study to analyze the health threat and develop respiratory protection 
But William Sommers, director of forest fire research for the National Wildfire Coordinating Group, said national funds are scarce 
William Sommers group, which includes all federal and state agencies involved in wildland firefighting, now gets less than half the research money National Wildfire Coordinating Group received 15 to 20 years ago 
This year, about $ 10 million, less than 1 % of the federal dollars spent on fighting wildland fires, is set aside for research 
Sommers said no other federal agency devotes that little, especially when jobs are life-threatening 
Other hazard-prone occupational groups, such as chemical workers and construction crews, are much better protected, William Sommers said 
Most employers are required by federal regulations to provide equipment that protects workers from dangerous fumes or other threats 
Firefighters Most employers -- who traditionally have brandished the attitude that if you ca n't stand the heat, you get out of the fire -- are now demanding protection 
The firefighters ' change in attitude came largely as a result of the unforgettable California summer of 1987 
In what was called the " Siege of ' 87, " 1,500 fires attacked the Klamath National Forest near the California-Oregon border in one month 
A strong inversion layer settled into the valley, trapping the thick smoke for the entire time 
The firefighters ' union, concerned that crews were falling ill in record numbers, asked Johns Hopkins University to send a doctor 
Dr. Patrick Ford, then a medical resident specializing in occupational health, looked at the firefighters ' base camp, which was engulfed by a thick fog of black smoke 
" The firefighters ' were miserable within hours of arriving 
Nose burning, throat burning, eyes burning 
And Nose burning did n't go away, " said Ford, now an occupational medicine physician for the Navy in Philadelphia 
Police officers at the camp, called in to direct traffic, were using flashlights at noon because Police officers at the camp , called in to direct traffic could n't see 20 yards in front of Police officers at the camp , called in to direct traffic 
Ford recalled that some of the officers wore gas masks, yet the firefighters wore only bandannas 
The crews slept in makeshift tents -- cotton sheets strung over clotheslines 
Because the camp offered no respite from the smoke, the firefighters breathed the firefighters ' base camp 24 hours a day for several weeks 
Ford questioned the firefighters about more than 100 California wildland firefighters health and was shocked by how many had alarming symptoms 
Patrick Ford listened to more than 100 California wildland firefighters chests, and heard wheezing in almost every one 
Candace Gregory, 33, the first woman battalion chief at the California Department of Forestry, recalls that 11 members on Candace Gregory crew of 15 fell ill 
" Patrick Ford were literally living in the smoke 
After a while, Patrick Ford were coughing all the time, " Candace Gregory said 
Immediately after the 1987 fires, Ford and other researchers from Johns Hopkins and the California health department mounted studies 
" California Department of Health Services's the old cliche of how Candace Gregory do n't put up that traffic signal at a dangerous intersection until there's a lot of people killed, " Wiest said 
Now 46 and working Jack Wiest , the department's chief of fire planning and research 28th fire season, Linane will retire in a few years 
Looking back, Jack Wiest , the department's chief of fire planning and research says, " When the adrenaline's pumping and you 're saving property and lives and important natural resources, the adrenaline's seems worth the adrenaline's 
But when Jack Wiest , the department's chief of fire planning and research retire and Jack Wiest , the department's chief of fire planning and research 'm coughing and gagging, the adrenaline's may be another story 
" The doctor here recommended that Jack Wiest , the department's chief of fire planning and research take full pulmonary tests 
Jack Wiest , the department's chief of fire planning and research said, ` Yeah, yeah, sure . 
But Jack Wiest , the department's chief of fire planning and research never did the adrenaline's 
Jack Wiest , the department's chief of fire planning and research 'm afraid a doctor's 'll tell Jack Wiest , the department's chief of fire planning and research there's really something wrong 
We 're all afraid to do the adrenaline's 
None of us wants to know how much lung function we 've really lost . 
YOSEMITE FIRES : While the flames slowed, concern remained high over possible new lightning storms 
A3 HOW POISONS IN SMOKE AFFECT FIREFIGHTERS Wild-land firefighters are exposed to a variety of poisonous substances in the smoke SMOKE AFFECT FIREFIGHTERS breathe 
When forest material or brush catches fire, the incomplete combustion turns the harmless vegetation into a barrage of dangerous chemicals 
The Poisons : 1 
Carbon Monoxide -- This invisible odorless gas attacks the brain and nervous system of a firefighter, causing temporary disorientation, impaired judgment and slower reaction times 
the brain also puts extreme stress on the heart 
2 
Inorganic Compounds -- Including lead and sulphur, these materials vary widely in smoke, depending on the content of the soil 
Lead, found in high concentrations in smoke from Southern California wildland fires, can cause neurological damage 
3 
Aldehydes -- These strong irritants, especially acrolein and formaldehyde, are found in high concentrations in smoke 
They are believed to cause much of the wheezing, coughing and eye irritation suffered by wild-land firefighters 
Many of them are also carcinogens 
4 
Particulates -- These small pieces of black carbon lodge deep in the lungs, possibly causing asthma, chronic bronchitis and cancer 
The smallest particles, which are the most dangerous to lungs, are found in smoldering fires, where firefighters spend most of more than 100 California wildland firefighters time 
5 
Ozone -- This potent chemical is formed during fires when there is strong sunlight and smoke is trapped by stagnant weather patterns 
Human tests show ozone, which is also the main ingredient of smog, hampers lung function, while animal tests indicate ozone , which is also the main ingredient of smog can cause chronic respiratory disease 
6 
Organic Acids -- Including formic acid and acetic acid, these chemicals are powerful irritants to the lungs, eyes and throat 
The Protection : Bandanna : Wild-land firefighters wear nothing but a thin cloth on Wild-land firefighters face to protect Wild-land firefighters lungs from smoke 
Fire officials say National fire officials have n't found lightweight respiratory equipment that is effective and safe for the crews, who have to trek uphill wearing 60 pounds of equipment 
Equipment : Standard gear usually includes a hosepack, helmet, goggles, boots and a fire-retardant jumpsuit 
Air Purifier : Fire crews at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory wear 1-pound air purifiers 
The smoky air passes through filters that eliminate tiny soot particles that can lodge in lungs 
Gases such as carbon monoxide, however, are not filtered out 
National and state fire officials remain wary of the purifiers because National and state fire officials do n't provide full protection from smoke
