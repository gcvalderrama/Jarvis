Eight years after a volcano scare incited fear , anger and economic gloom in Sierra resorts , residents are nonchalant about renewed underground lava movement that is triggering thousands of tiny earthquakes 
Scientists say there is a very small chance of a volcanic eruption 
But most of the quakes are too small to be felt , so `` you do n't really think about it , '' said Pam Murphy , spokeswoman for Mammoth Mountain Ski Area 
`` You can get hit by a car , '' she said 
`` You can be in a plane crash 
The chances of those are a lot higher than the chance of being killed by an earthquake or a volcano . 
`` People who are frightened left long ago 
Mammoth Lakes Mayor Gordon Alper do n't believe a conscious concern of anyone in the community's a conscious concern of anyone in the community , '' said Mammoth Lakes Mayor Gordon Alper 
The resort town's 4,700 permanent residents live in Long Valley , a 19-mile-long , 9-mile-wide volcanic crater known as a caldera 
The resort town 's is located on the east slope of the Sierra Nevada range 250 miles north of Los Angeles 
The Earth's crust is being stretched apart in the region , allowing molten rock to fill half-mile-wide chambers under the caldera 
The valley was created 730,000 years ago by one of Earth's most powerful eruptions , a blast that spewed 600 times more material than the May 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington state 
Eruptions somewhat smaller than Mount St. Helens ' happened 550 years ago at the Inyo craters , which span Long Valley's north rim , and 650 years ago at the Mono craters , several miles north of the caldera 
Despite the current activity , the probability of a major earthquake or a volcanic eruption in the area is `` less than 1 percent each year , '' said David Hill , the U.S. Geological Survey geophysicist in charge of research at Long Valley 
Mono County Sheriff Martin Strelneck called such estimates `` a scientific guessing game , '' and said area residents rarely discuss the latest swarm of earthquakes , which started in May 1989 
That low-key attitude contrasts with feelings of anxiety , denial and hostility when thousands of quakes - some exceeding 6 on the Richter scale - rocked the area from 1979 to 1984 
During that period , subterranean molten rock pushed upward , lifting the caldera's floor 
As a result , the Geological Survey issued a `` notice of potential volcanic hazard '' for Long Valley in May 1982 
That warning , coupled with jarring earthquakes , damaged tourism and aggravated a recession in the once-booming real estate market 
`` The community overreacted , '' Murphy said 
Residents accused journalists of sensationalizing the possibility of an eruption and denounced scientists for scaring people 
`` Initially residents thought this was a big ploy for them to get funding from Congress , '' Alper said 
The hazard notice was rescinded in 1984 after the beleaguered Geological Survey changed U.S. Geological Survey warning system and seismic activity diminished , reducing the possibility of an eruption 
Swarms of thousands of small quakes resumed 18 months ago and continue to rattle Mammoth Lakes , June Lake , Lee Vining and other Mono County resort towns 
The temblors , most measuring 1 to 3 on the Richter scale , started beneath Mammoth Mountain 
In September 1989 , The temblors shifted to the caldera , where five to 10 small quakes now happen daily 
A quake estimated at 5 to 5.8 on the Richter scale shook the region last Tuesday , tumbling rocks onto Yosemite National Park's roads 
A quake estimated at 5 to 5.8 on the Richter scale was eastern California's largest quake since 1984 , but was n't related to volcanic activity that causes the quake swarms , Hill said 
Long Valley's floor continues to bulge upward as molten rock moves inside two or three chambers about four miles under the caldera , David Hill said 
The caldera floor rose about 2 feet since 1979 , including 3 inches in the past year 
While Long Valley `` is clearly an area that's showing unrest , large calderas can do these kinds of things over years to decades without necessarily erupting , '' Hill said 
The floor of a caldera near Naples , Italy , rose 9 feet between 1970 and 1984 but did n't erupt 
Comparable uplift inside a New Guinea caldera also failed to produce volcanic disaster 
Nevertheless , Hill said , eastern Sierra residents are addressing the volcanic threat by developing or revising emergency plans and helping the Geological Survey prepare a new system to issue a warning if an eruption appeared likely
