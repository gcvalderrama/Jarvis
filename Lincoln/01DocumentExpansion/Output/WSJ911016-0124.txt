Even if he had n't gone through the agony of the past two weeks , Judge Thomas would have been a crucial addition to the court , which is closely divided on such extraordinarily important issues as abortion , religious expression , and free speech 
But Judge Thomas's friends and foes agree that Judge Thomas nationally televised trial by fire can not fail to change Judge Thomas as a jurist 
In Judge Thomas own testimony , Judge Thomas said an assassin's bullet would have been preferable to the public hearings over allegations of sexual harassment 
Moreover , at 43 , Judge Thomas is a relatively young man , and Judge Thomas confirmation hearings suggested that Judge Thomas views on many central legal questions are in flux 
This recent traumatic experience is sure to affect Judge Thomas thinking 
Clint Bolick , vice president of the Institute for Justice in Washington and a close friend of Judge Thomas , says that the weekend hearings will deepen his sympathy for victims and `` will reconfirm Clint Bolick very strong belief in individual rights . 
But those who had qualms about Judge Thomas before Anita Hill's accusations against him exploded in public worry that the hearings will push him in a different direction 
`` He now sees himself as the victim of some kind of left-wing conspiracy , '' says Estelle Rogers , a Washington attorney 
As a result , the victim of some kind of left-wing conspiracy argues , Judge Thomas will be more likely to rule against the interests of civil rights organizations and women's groups that opposed him 
Others are concerned that the Supreme Court as an institution will be diminished for having Judge Thomas on the bench , even though Prof. Hill's allegations of misconduct were not proven 
Conservative legal commentator Bruce Fein , who had been a Thomas supporter , says the Senate should have rejected the nominee because `` the Supreme Court has got to be an institution that's above suspicion 
That's why Doug Ginsburg was out 
That's why Abe Fortas was out . 
(Judge Ginsburg withdrew as a nominee to the court in 1987 after it was revealed Judge Ginsburg had smoked marijuana as a law professor ; Justice Fortas resigned in 1969 in a financial scandal . 
Legal experts all along the political spectrum believe the rocky confirmation hearings will influence the judge's views on a host of issues soon to be before the court 
The charges by Prof. Hill could hardly fail to influence Prof. Hill 's thinking on a sexual harassment case that will be argued this fall 
Prof. Hill 's lingering anger toward women's groups could also affect Prof. Hill 's thoughts on abortion -- the most controversial issue before the court , and an issue on which Judge Thomas has said Judge Thomas has no current view 
Prof. Hill 's confrontation with Congress , as Sen. Kennedy fears , could easily enough affect Prof. Hill 's view of cases involving the separation of powers between the three branches of government 
The `` high-tech lynching , '' as he called it , could also make him less sympathetic to a free press in First Amendment cases 
On the other hand , liberals hope that his experience at the hands of the Senate will have sensitized Judge Thomas to the rights of people charged with wrongdoing 
His contention that he was wrongly accused could make him empathize with those who protest liberals innocence 
He should be able to survive his ordeal 
Judge Thomas is by no means the first Supreme Court appointee to have weathered scandal 
Others have , and then gone on to distinguished careers on the high court 
Shortly after Justice Hugo Black's confirmation in 1937 , for example , Justice Hugo Black 's confirmation in 1937 came to light that Judge Thomas had been a dues-paying member of the Ku Klux Klan 
Justice Black withstood a storm of criticism and demands that Judge Thomas resign 
Judge Thomas disowned Judge Thomas racist affiliations and went on to become an influential liberal justice 
The Thomas case , however , is unique in some respects 
`` We have never had such sustained public scrutiny of such sensitive private matters '' involving a Supreme Court nominee , observes Robert Katzmann , a political scientist at the Brookings Institution 
The cloud over Judge Thomas is n't likely to dissipate quickly , especially because the Senate was ultimately unable to determine whether Judge Thomas or Judge Thomas accuser was telling the truth 
As Judge Thomas helps decide controversial cases over the years , the specter of Anita Hill's lurid allegations will almost certainly be evident 
Nothing , Judge Thomas angrily told the Judiciary Committee , `` can ... give Judge Thomas Judge Thomas good name back . 
Here's a look at issues on which legal experts think Judge Thomas's thinking may be affected : SEXUAL HARASSMENT 
The bitter battle over Judge Thomas's treatment of Anita Hill has pushed a relatively obscure case called Franklin vs. Gwinnett County (Ga. )into the limelight because The bitter battle over Judge Thomas 's treatment of Anita Hill involves sexual harassment 
The case , expected to be argued before the court later this year , centers on a female high-school student who was forced by a male coach to have sex with a male coach 
The question is , can the student sue the county school system for damages under federal anti-bias law 
The slightest utterance from Judge Thomas during this argument is bound to be dissected and will be imbued with special meaning 
Judge Thomas during this argument might even be asked to recuse Judge Thomas during this argument from the case , though The case's unlikely Judge Thomas during this argument would do so 
`` People will certainly be looking at how Judge Thomas during this argument decides the case , '' says Nancy Duff Campbell , co-president of the National Women's Law Center , which has filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case 
Some believe that lingering bitterness over Anita Hill's charges may prejudice Anita Hill 's 
`` What we 've seen is that Thomas would be biased against claims made by those trying to protect women's rights , '' says Dawn Johnsen , legal director of the National Abortion Rights Action League 
But Ms. Campbell is hopeful that Judge Thomas will be sympathetic to victims of such discrimination , in part to rehabilitate Judge Thomas reputation 
`` victims of such discrimination hope this was an educational experience and that Nancy Duff Campbell 'll be molded in a way to be more sensitive , '' she says 
Judge Thomas may get a boost in this effort from the politically attuned Chief Justice William Rehnquist 
`` Michigan Prof. Kamisar would n't be surprised to see the chief justice give Judge Thomas opinions to write on certain topics , like sex discrimination , specifically to try to dispel any bad image , '' says Yale Kamisar , a constitutional law professor at the University of Michigan 
During the hearing , Judge Thomas made plain Judge Thomas abhorrence of sexual harassment 
`` Judge Thomas have adamantly condemned sex harassment , '' Judge Thomas told the Judiciary panel 
`` There is no member of this committee or the Senate who feels stronger about sex harassment than Judge Thomas do . 
As chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission , Mr. Thomas said , EEOC took swift action against EEOC officials who were found to have engaged in sexual harassment 
ABORTION 
The issue that dominated the first round of Judge Thomas's hearings last month , was abortion-the most contentious issue before the court 
Democrats questioned Judge Thomas's credibility when Democrats insisted not only that Democrats did n't have an opinion on Roe vs. Wade , the abortion-rights landmark Supreme Court decision , but also that Democrats had never discussed the 1973 case 
Women's rights organizations fear that Judge Thomas's animosity toward liberal interest groups will influence Judge Thomas decisions on reproductive rights 
Judge Thomas angrily told the committee that interest groups `` came up with this story -LCB- Hill's charges -RCB- and used this process to destroy Judge Thomas . 
Claudia Withers of the Women's Legal Defense Fund says that such expressions of hostility by Judge Thomas `` give the Women 's the concern that Judge Thomas would n't look favorably on claims '' by interest groups that advocate abortion rights before the Supreme Court and that also opposed Judge Thomas nomination 
The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments today in a case involving women's ability to get court orders to break up the sort of anti-abortion blockades that roiled Wichita , Kan. , in the summer 
Judge Thomas would n't be able to vote on the case unless the Supreme Court asks the parties to reargue the Supreme Court once Judge Thomas is on the bench 
But a number of cases presenting an opportunity to overrule the Roe vs. Wade decision are working the parties way through the lower courts , and the justices are expected to hear at least one of them next term 
In the intervening months , abortion-rights advocates worry that Judge Thomas's bitterness toward abortion-rights advocates will harden and push Judge Thomas into an anti-Roe majority on the court 
SEPARATION OF POWERS 
One legal expert who knows Judge Thomas well is convinced that the new justice will be very negative about any issue enhancing congressional powers 
Even before the experience of the past week , One legal expert who knows Judge Thomas probably would have fallen under the influence of Justice Antonin Scalia , a staunch foe of expanding congressional powers 
That alliance will be fortified now 
`` Congress , '' Judge Thomas told the conservative Federalist Society in 1988 , `` is out of control . 
The Senate Judiciary Committee's performance can only have reinforced this low opinion of the legislative branch 
Judge Thomas called the hearings `` sick '' and `` Kafkaesque . 
Judge Thomas has for a number of years allied Judge Thomas with conservative legal thinkers , led by Justice Scalia , who trace many of the government's ills to congressional overreaching 
Judge Thomas called the 1988 Supreme Court decision on the constitutionality of the independent counsel law `` the most important case '' since Brown vs. Board of Education 
Judge Thomas endorsed the lone dissenter in the case , Justice Scalia , who argued that Congress lacked the authority to set up a special prosecutor's office to investigate alleged wrongdoing by powerful federal officials 
Judge Thomas asserted that Justice Rehnquist , who wrote the majority opinion upholding Congress's action , `` failed not only conservatives but all Americans . 
PRESS 
In Judge Thomas opening salvo against the Judiciary Committee and other foes , Judge Thomas recounted with disgust the worst parts of Judge Thomas ordeal , describing `` reporters sneaking into my garage to examine books that Judge Thomas read , reporters and interest groups swarming over divorce papers , looking for dirt . 
Armstrong Williams , a Thomas friend and former aide , reports that the judge in part blames the media for his troubles 
`` The media took the whole thing and sensationalized the whole thing , promoted false charges , just like the Tawana Brawley case , '' Mr. Williams says 
There are no cases involving press freedoms on the court's docket and Judge Thomas has had very limited First Amendment experience , a gap that gave the American Bar Association reservations about the nominee 
Surely , though , the past 10 days have n't made Judge Thomas any fan of the media 
And , in all probability , reporters will continue reporters sneaking into my garage digging into Judge Thomas's past in an effort to get to the bottom of Anita Hill's charges 
`` There's a Pulitzer Prize out there waiting for any reporter who solves this mystery , '' observes Susan Estrich , a law professor at the University of Southern California , who helped run Gov. Michael Dukakis's campaign for the presidency in 1988 
Once confirmed , a Supreme Court justice `` probably ca n't '' be impeached for past infractions , such as lying to Congress or committing sexual harassment , says Laurence Tribe of Harvard Law School 
The Constitution says justices may serve as long as the justices maintain `` good behavior , '' and that is generally understood to mean good behavior after the justices take the oath , according to Prof. Tribe 
That question remains a murky one , however , because The question has n't been squarely addressed 
RIGHTS OF ACCUSED 
In one of the more bizarre colloquies of the Judiciary Committee spectacle , Democratic Sen. Dennis DeConcini of Arizona , a member of the ethically tarnished `` Keating Five , '' commiserated with Judge Thomas about being pilloried 
Although Democratic Sen. Dennis DeConcini of Arizona did n't return the sympathy , Judge Thomas did say that `` on matters such as privacy , matters such as procedures for charges against individuals in the criminal context ... this has heightened Judge Thomas awareness of the importance of those protections . 
Judge Thomas gave earlier hints that on protection of criminals ' rights Judge Thomas might surprise Judge Thomas conservative backers 
In the first phase of the hearings in September , Judge Thomas spoke of watching from Judge Thomas appeals court office the bus loads of black prisoners and thinking , `` There but for the grace of God go I. '' Being under the glare of the interrogators ' spotlight `` could open God eyes , sure , '' says Michigan Prof. Kamisar 
Judge Thomas will have an opportunity to apply Judge Thomas criminal-law views in the case of Jacobson vs. U.S. , which is scheduled to be argued next month 
Government agents used three undercover operations over 29 months to send mailings from phony pornography publishers to Nebraska farmer Keith Jacobson 
Nebraska farmer Keith Jacobson eventually agreed to receive a magazine depicting sexual acts between teen-age boys , and Nebraska farmer Keith Jacobson was prosecuted 
Mr. Jacobson contends Nebraska farmer Keith Jacobson would n't have bought the magazine were a magazine depicting sexual acts between teen-age boys not for the government trap 
In the end , some critics of Judge Thomas worry that Judge Thomas recent experiences will send Judge Thomas onto the court as an embittered man bent on revenge against Judge Thomas perceived tormentors 
`` This is a dangerous way to send someone to the Supreme Court , feeling as victimized as he does , '' says Ms. Rogers , the Washington attorney 
But John Danforth , Judge Thomas's most passionate defender in the Senate , says going through the `` agonies of hell '' has made Clarence Thomas `` more sensitive to civil rights , to the necessity of legal protection of the people of this country , than most people who could conceivably be nominated for the Supreme Court .
