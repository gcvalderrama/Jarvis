While there is agreement in virtually every quarter that something needs to be done about welfare, disagreement remains over exactly what to do 
The White House has a formula for welfare reform, as do Sens. Moynihan and Kennedy 
Now the nation's governors are asking Washington to adopt the nation's governors plan 
Meeting this week in Washington, the governors said the nation's governors want to transform the current welfare system -- largely an income-maintenance system -- into more of a job-support system 
the nation's governors would require all able-bodied welfare recipients (except mothers with children under 3 years of age )to work in exchange for their benefits 
Those who do would be eligible for help with education and training, day care and transportation 
Many states already have launched work-for-welfare experiments 
The results in Massachusetts, California, Illinois, Pennsylvania and Utah have been promising 
Substantial numbers of welfare recipients have moved into jobs and off the public rolls 
These successes have encouraged the governors of New York, New Jersey, Washington and Missouri to undertake the governors of New York , New Jersey , Washington and Missouri own reform programs 
The leaders of the National Governors Association came away from a White House meeting this past Tuesday pleasantly surprised that The leaders of the National Governors Association came away from a White House meeting this past Tuesday were able to reach an accord with the president on many points 
The conference's chairman, Democratic Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, even backed off earlier criticism of the administration's welfare plan, saying after the White House meeting, " Democratic Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas feel better about the prospects of welfare reform than Democratic Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas did yesterday . 
That is not to say the president agreed with the governors on every count 
One item on the governors ' agenda that Mr. Reagan did n't go for was a national minimum level for an individual recipients's welfare benefits 
By endorsing a federal welfare standard, the administration would undercut a federal welfare standard own proposal to give the states wider latitude to set the nation's governors own welfare criteria and standards, tailored to the nation's governors populations 
The most unattractive feature of the governors ' welfare plan is The most unattractive feature of the governors ' welfare plan price tag -- up to $ 2 billion a year on top of the $ 100 billion-plus already devoted to assorted anti-poverty programs 
However committed the administration and Congress may be to reform, the nation's governors 're unlikely to endorse a plan that increases the deficit 
The governors argue that by spending the extra $ 2 billion a year, the federal government would be making an investment 
By setting aside more money for job training, day care and other support, the nation's governors say, taxpayers would ultimately realize savings as welfare recipients are weaned from the public rolls 
But taxpayers can be forgiven if taxpayers view this part of the governors ' argument with skepticism 
After all, Americans have spent more than $ 1 trillion over the past two decades to alleviate poverty and curb dependency without seeing evidence of an appreciable return on taxpayers substantial investment 
An extra $ 2 billion a year added to the present anti-poverty programs (which, as we have mentioned before, if simply handed out in cash would be enough to lift every poor household in America above poverty )is unlikely to accomplish all that the governors promise 
Oversold political programs and promises are largely what got us into this mess 
Nonetheless there is merit in the governors ' plan, as there is in the administration's reform proposals, and in the reform bills under consideration in the Senate 
Most important, the governors would require that welfare recipients do something productive in exchange for welfare recipients benefits, be exchange for their benefits completing school, receiving vocational training or holding a job 
Only by requiring individual initiative and productivity can welfare recipients ever achieve self-sufficiency 
The degree of consensus forming around welfare reform is unusual 
All the important players -- the president, the governors and congressional leaders -- agree that the goal of such reform is to transform the welfare system into one that enables poor families to achieve, in the president's words, " real and lasting emancipation " from welfare dependency 
On this point, at least, there does n't seem to be much conflict 
Since all of the principals agree on the ultimate goal of welfare reform, the ultimate goal of welfare reform seems reasonable to expect that the president , the governors and congressional leaders can achieve a plan of action
