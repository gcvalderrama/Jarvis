President Bush's son Neil was unqualified to be a director of a Colorado thrift, but that does n't excuse him from harm caused to the institution that failed at a cost of $ 1 billion, federal regulators say 
Neil Bush described President Bush's Wednesday as " just a Denver guy trying to make a living and raise a family, " and not as a freewheeling former director of Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan Association 
Bush, 34, continued to deny conflict of interest allegations raised against President Bush's by thrift regulators 
Meanwhile, President Bush strongly defended President Bush's son on Wednesday, saying President Bush's has confidence in President Bush's " honor and integrity . 
The president, who has pledged to vigorously prosecute fraud in the savings and loan industry, repeated The president promise not to interfere with regulators ' investigation of The president son 
" If The president's done something wrong, the system will digest that, " The president , who has pledged to vigorously prosecute fraud in the savings and loan industry told a news conference in Houston 
" This is not easy for The president , who has pledged to vigorously prosecute fraud in the savings and loan industry as a father 
It's easy for a father because the system is going to work 
The president , who has pledged to vigorously prosecute fraud in the savings and loan industry am not going to intervene . 
In documents released by the Office of Thrift Supervision, regulators asserted that Neil Bush was " unqualified and untrained " for President Bush's position as an outside director of Denver-based Silverado 
" Certainly President Bush's had no experience in managing a large corporation, especially a financial institution with almost $ 2 billion in assets, " said the documents released this week 
" Unfortunately, President Bush's was not cognizant of the conflict-of-interest situations President Bush's encountered as a director of Silverado . 
However, the regulators added, Bush's inexperience does not excuse President Bush's " from the harm and potential harm President Bush's caused " to the thrift 
The younger Bush has been ordered by the thrift office to answer allegations of conflict of interest in his role as a director of Silverado, which lent millions of dollars to his business partner, who never repaid the money 
At a news conference in Denver, Neil Bush said, " President Bush's am standing on very solid ground when a news conference in Denver comes to defending President Bush's role as an outside director . 
President Bush's said that President Bush's father " had wanted President Bush's to keep a little lower profile . 
However, President Bush's told reporters for The Denver Post after the news conference that President Bush's is thinking about running for Congress because President Bush's thinks there should be more congressional accountability 
" President Bush's may (run -RRB-, " President Bush's said 
" Not anytime soon because -LRB- run -RRB-'s something President Bush's have to build up to 
But if President Bush's do -LRB- run -RRB-, -LRB- run -RRB-'s probably going to be with the intent of being part of a shakeup . 
The federal government is considering filing lawsuits to recover misspent funds from the officers and directors of 1,300 failed banks and savings institutions, officials told a congressional hearing Wednesday 
Neil Bush could be among the defendants 
L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., appearing at Wednesday's hearing, declined to comment on whether FDIC officials have recommended whether to sue Neil Bush 
" FDIC officials are treating the Silverado case the way FDIC officials treat every other case, " Seidman told the House Judiciary subcommittee on criminal justice 
" Every failed institution, FDIC officials go into and make a thorough investigation of whether or not there is the possibility of civil or criminal activity .
