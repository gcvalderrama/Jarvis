Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan , looking back on his work for Lincoln Savings and Loan Association , says [he(PRP)| Alan Greenspan(NNP)] does n't believe [he(PRP)| Alan Greenspan(NNP)] could have foreseen the thrift 's spectacular failure , expected to be the costliest in the nation 's history . 
Nearly five years ago , Greenspan testified before Congress as a private consultant and lobbied regulators on behalf of Lincoln and [its(PRP$)| Nearly five years(NNS)] owner , Phoenix , Ariz. , millionaire Charles H. Keating Jr. . 
Keating objected to federal regulations restricting thrift institutions ' direct investments in real estate development . 
Greenspan , a conservative economist generally opposed to government meddling in business , supported [him(PRP)| Alan Greenspan(NNP)] . 
In an interview last week , Greenspan said [he(PRP)| Alan Greenspan(NNP)] was surprised and distressed by Lincoln 's eventual failure because of sour real estate deals . 
But [he(PRP)| Alan Greenspan(NNP)] said [he(PRP)| Alan Greenspan(NNP)] still supports short-term direct investments when thrifts are exposed to interest rate risks . 
Supporters of direct investments have long argued that [they(PRP)| Supporters of direct investments(NNS)] can benefit S&Ls struggling with a portfolio of long-term mortgages . 
`` [I(PRP)| Alan Greenspan(NNP)] look back and [I(PRP)| Alan Greenspan(NNP)] say to [myself(PRP)| Alan Greenspan(NNP)] , ` Was there something [I(PRP)| Alan Greenspan(NNP)] should have seen and did n't see ? ' 
and the answer is , ` There was nothing visible _ at least to [me(PRP)| Alan Greenspan(NNP)] , '' ' Greenspan said . 
In early 1985 , Irvine , Calif.-based Lincoln was a fast-growing institution under aggressive managers who eschewed traditional home-mortgage lending . 
Greenspan was a private economist with impressive political credentials as President Ford 's chief economic adviser a decade earlier . 
Now , Lincoln is insolvent and under government control . 
Regulators say [it(PRP)| Lincoln(NNP)] will cost taxpayers $ 2 billion to protect [its(PRP$)| Lincoln(NNP)] depositors , making [it(PRP)| Lincoln(NNP)] the nation 's largest S&L failure . 
Greenspan is no longer a private consultant and , suddenly , [his(PRP$)| Alan Greenspan(NNP)] five-year-old statements loom large . 
As chairman of the Federal Reserve Board , [he(PRP)| chairman of the Federal Reserve Board(NN)] is considered by many to be , after the president , the most powerful official in the nation . 
The Fed influences daily life , perhaps more than any other government agency , through [its(PRP$)| the Federal Reserve Board(NNP)] manipulation of the economy and credit . 
In a Feb. 13 , 1985 , letter to the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco , Greenspan argued that Lincoln deserved an exemption from regulations limiting to 10 percent thrifts ' direct investment in real estate and other commercial ventures . 
Lincoln 's management , [he(PRP)| Alan Greenspan(NNP)] said , was `` seasoned and expert in selecting and making direct investments '' with `` a long and continuous track record of outstanding success . '' 
The institution itself was `` financially strong , '' in a `` vibrant and healthy state '' and `` present -LRB- ed -RRB- no foreseeable risk to the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. , '' [he(PRP)| Alan Greenspan(NNP)] said . 
Two weeks later , on Feb. 27 , 1985 , Greenspan told the House Government Operations subcommittee on consumer , commerce and monetary affairs that direct investments , while undoubtedly risky , were essential for thrifts to diversify [their(PRP$)| Lincoln(NNP)] holdings . 
Traditional S&Ls , which took in short-term deposits and made long-term mortgage loans , were vulnerable to a sharp rise in interest rates and direct investments were a valuable alternative , [he(PRP)| Alan Greenspan(NNP)] said . 
[He(PRP)| Alan Greenspan(NNP)] also endorsed a study by economist George Bentsen , now with Emory University , which cited the success of 17 S&Ls in direct investments . 
Fifteen of the 17 have since failed . 
`` It was my view then , as [it(PRP)| my view(NN)] is now , that interest rate risk was the crucial problem confronting S&Ls _ the problem of long-term assets financed by short-term deposits . 
In that particular context , at that particular time , direct investment would reduce risk , '' [he(PRP)| Alan Greenspan(NNP)] said . 
Greenspan still believes Bentsen took a `` rather sensible statistical approach '' but [he(PRP)| Alan Greenspan(NNP)] points out that most of the 17 S&Ls cited in [his(PRP$)| Alan Greenspan(NNP)] study were located in Texas , later the center of the oil and real estate bust . 
The central bank chairman 's views have been cited as one of the reasons why a petition , calling on S&L regulators to postpone direct investment limits , attracted 225 signatures in the House in early 1985 . 
It is also being cited as a reason why , two years later , five senators decided to intervene with S&L regulators after Keating complained about [their(PRP$)| S&L regulators(NNS)] efforts to examine Lincoln 's finances . 
The five _ Alan Cranston , D-Calif. ; Dennis DeConcini , D-Ariz. ; Donald W. Riegle Jr. , D-Mich. ; John Glenn , D-Ohio , and John McCain , R-Ariz . 
_ met with the regulators in April 1987 . 
Two of them _ Cranston and McCain _ said Greenspan 's views on Lincoln 's health heavily influenced [their(PRP$)| Lincoln(NNP)] thinking . 
`` The problem , as conveyed to [me(PRP)| Alan Cranston(NNP)] at the time , not only by Mr. Keating but also by Mr. Greenspan and Arthur Young & Co. -LRB- an accounting firm -RRB- was that federal examiners bore substantial responsibility for creating a most destructive and irrational state of limbo for this institution , '' Cranston told the Senate Ethics Committee in a Nov. 16 letter . 
Greenspan said [he(PRP)| Alan Greenspan(NNP)] does not understand why the senators cite his opinion as a reason for actions taken so long after [it(PRP)| his opinion(NN)] was given . 
`` [You(PRP)| Alan Cranston(NNP)] do not rely on a 2 -LCB- - year-old letter unless you call the guy who wrote it . 
No one ever called [me(PRP)| Alan Greenspan(NNP)] , '' [he(PRP)| Alan Greenspan(NNP)] said . 
Greenspan , as president of Townsend Greenspan & Co. , was hired to review Lincoln 's condition by the New York law firm of Paul Weiss , Rifkind , Wharton & Garrison . 
[He(PRP)| Alan Greenspan(NNP)] said [he(PRP)| Alan Greenspan(NNP)] could not remember how much [he(PRP)| Alan Greenspan(NNP)] was paid for [his(PRP$)| Alan Greenspan(NNP)] work , but said [he(PRP)| Alan Greenspan(NNP)] charged [his(PRP$)| Alan Greenspan(NNP)] usual hourly rate . 
The partners of the law firm , [he(PRP)| Alan Greenspan(NNP)] said , were long-time , trusted associates . 
`` [They(PRP)| The partners of the law firm(NNS)] certainly never gave [me(PRP)| Alan Greenspan(NNP)] the slightest impression that these were other than good people '' at Lincoln . 
Greenspan said [he(PRP)| Alan Greenspan(NNP)] recalls meeting Keating himself two or three times , but never for a detailed , analytical discussion . 
The people working under Keating `` frankly [I(PRP)| Phoenix , Ariz. , millionaire Charles H. Keating Jr.(NNP)] found fairly impressive , '' [he(PRP)| Phoenix , Ariz. , millionaire Charles H. Keating Jr.(NNP)] said .
