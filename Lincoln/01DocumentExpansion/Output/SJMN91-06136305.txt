You can have your tamale and eat your tamale  too , says Rachel Torres , diabetes educator at San Jose Hospital and coordinator of the Diabetes Society of Santa Clara Valley's Hispanic Education Program. ; The secret to eating Mexican and other Hispanic foods while still maintaining a healthy diet is in the preparation of the food , Rachel Torres  said 
Beginning this summer , Torres and other health professionals will be offering nutrition and exercise classes geared toward Hispanics in an effort to educate Torres and other health professionals  on the dangers of diabetes. ; According to state Health Department statistics , the incidence of diabetes in the Hispanic population is three times that of the general population 
Health experts believe the Hispanic diet and genetic predisposition may be contributing factors. ; Health experts  food is one of the richest in terms of taste and nutrition , said Torres 
But the Hispanic diet  is the way Health experts  prepare the food that messes things up for Health experts  
; In her classes , Torres said Rachel Torres  will instruct her students to prepare tamales , refried beans and other traditional Hispanic dishes using polyunsaturated oil rather than the more traditional recipes that call for the use of lard 
And instead of eating four tortillas at one sitting , Rachel Torres  recommends her students  be eaten throughout the day. ; Although courses for Hispanic diabetics and their families have been offered by the Diabetic Society for almost three years , lessons on the benefits of good nutrition and exercise to combat the disease will be offered for the first time. ; Sue Ann Kelly , education director for the Diabetes Society , said the classes may be the first ones ever geared specifically toward the Hispanic lifestyle. ; It is a powerful feeling our educators get when our educators  discover all the cultural issues that come in to play when dealing with diabetes , Rachel Torres  said. ; IF YOU are INTERESTED ; The next course for Hispanic diabetics and Hispanic diabetics  families will be 9 a.m. to noon Saturday at Alexian Brother's Hospital , 225 N.
