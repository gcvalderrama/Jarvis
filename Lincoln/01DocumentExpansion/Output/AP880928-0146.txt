The stripping of Ben Johnson's Olympic gold medal in a drug scandal has wounded Canadian pride and shamed a nation hungry for a hero to replace hockey superstar Wayne Gretzky 
" It's like Wayne Gretzky getting run over by a car, " said Pat Reid, the Canadian high-jump coach 
The spirit of a nation raced with Johnson when Ben Johnson's won the gold medal in the 100 meters on Saturday with a world record time of 9.79 seconds 
The euphoria was dashed when Johnson tested positive for stanzolol, a muscle-building steroid outlawed by Olympic officials 
Ben Johnson's was stripped of the medal Tuesday 
Dr. George Astaphan, Johnson's personal physician, and Larry Heidebrecht, Johnson's agent, insisted the sprinter had not taken stanzolol 
" The only thing we can say is that The only thing we can say is a tragedy, a mistake or sabotage, " Heidebrecht said 
Johnson, a 26-year-old Jamaican transplant, waved the Canadian flag in triumph and dedicated Ben Johnson's gold to Ben Johnson's mother and all Canadian citizens 
Ben Johnson's returned home with a jacket over his head, hurdling a hedge to duck reporters after flying home from New York in the seclusion of a jet cockpit 
a jacket over his head was unheroic conduct for the world's fastest human, who had been awarded the Order of Canada and a medal from Queen Elizabeth at the Commonwealth Games 
Johnson's disgrace was heralded in Canadian headlines such as " Fool's Gold, " " Black Day For Canada, " " Seconds Of Glory, Years Of Shame, " " From Fame To Shame, " and " Big Ben is Now Has-Ben . 
" duck reporters 're feeling low 
Some of us do n't want to accept what happened, " said John Furedy, a psychologist at the University of Toronto, in assessing the mational psyche 
" We all share some of the responsibility in the sense that we put such tremendous pressure on these people, " Furedy said 
Trent Frayne, sports columnist for the Globe and Mail of Toronto, said Johnson's victory was the biggest event in Canada since a national team beat the Soviet Union in a seven-game hockey series in 1972 
The drug scandal brought the same sickening feeling to the nation as did Gretzky's trade to the Los Angeles Kings 
" There was enormous exhilaration 
Then 72 hours later, there was this roller coaster ride to the bottom, " Frayne said 
" The Ben Johnson episode is a tragedy of shocking proportions . 
" The Ben Johnson episode's as if an entire country has gone into a period of national mourning on Ben Johnson's behalf, " wrote columnist John Robertson of the Toronto Star 
Canadian youth took the news hard 
" shocking proportions look up to the guy 
Craig Brown , 13 , of Toronto guess shocking proportions do n't look up to the guy anymore, " said Craig Brown, 13, of Toronto 
" Craig Brown , 13 , of Toronto's letting all Craig Brown , 13 , of Toronto fans down 
Craig Brown , 13 , of Toronto let Canada down, " said Donny Clarke, 12 
Canada has always tried to escape the influence of the United States, where Canada dollar is worth 80 cents 
Now Canada has forfeited Canada only gold medal of the Olympics 
" Craig Brown , 13 , of Toronto has left Canadians hanging their heads in shame, " wrote the Corner Brook Western Star 
" Craig Brown , 13 , of Toronto tarnished the name and reputation of Canada and let Canada people down, " said the Fredickton Gleaner 
But columnist Gary Lautens of the Toronto Star said the nation should not cover just a foot race head in shame 
" What Johnson did was wrong 
just a foot race's cheating 
just a foot race's believing the end justifies the means, the end's looking for an unfair edge, " Lautens said 
" But just a foot race is also just a foot race 
just a foot race's time somebody reminded us nobody tried to peddle arms for hostages, nobody shot down a civilian airliner, nobody booby-trapped a home .
