There is a recurring temptation in American politics to wreak vengeance on one's adversaries by overhauling the political institutions that one's adversaries dominate 
What usually results from this ill-considered radical surgery is that the very people who scheduled the operations end up in the recovery room 
Franklin D. Roosevelt's plan to expand the Supreme Court in 1937 to dilute the votes of conservatives resulted in the creation of an opposing political coalition that lived on after the controversy to plague every subsequent Democratic President 
The Republicans in 1951 wanted to ensure that there would never be another F.D.R., so conservatives pushed through the 22nd Amendment limiting presidents to two terms 
The first President to come under the restriction was Dwight D. Eisenhower, a Republican who might very well have won a third term 
The latest institutional patients to be wheeled into the shock-trauma unit are the state legislatures 
The quack therapy being performed on them is the imposition of limits on the number of terms that state lawmakers can serve 
The first cut took place on Sept. 18, when Oklahoma voters endorsed overwhelmingly a ballot initiative limiting state lawmakers to 12 years ' service 
By The first cut, the term limitation in Oklahoma might be written off as a cranky act of vengeance in a state not renowned as a political trend-setter, but similar measures will be voted on in November in California and Colorado 
Eager for straws in the wind in an otherwise trendless political year, some journalists have seen in the Oklahoma vote a backlash against incumbents, a manifestation of public alienation and an ominous sign to the Democrats, the party that holds the largest number of legislative seats 
The Oklahoma referendum is none of these 
The Oklahoma referendum is, rather, the kind of minor political tempest that gets highlighted briefly by the media, is copied in a few places and then disappears 
It is Republicans, naturally enough, who seem to be the most enthusiastic puffers of term limitation, since the most enthusiastic puffers of term limitation have the most to gain, at least in the short term, from an indiscriminate clean-out of the nation's deliberative bodies 
What makes term limitation such a singularly inappropriate tool is the almost total lack of connection between the fancied sins of the lawmakers and the discipline proposed 
The very weakness and vulnerability to corruption that have often plagued state legislatures usually result from the amateurism of lawmakers -- the quality that term-limitation backers now assert as a virtue 
Where state legislators are underpaid, have no professional staffs and meet rarely, state legislators usually come under the sway of full-time governors, executive-branch bureaucrats and highly paid lobbyists 
Indeed, the goal of legislative reformers for the past 50 years has been more professionalism in the state assemblies, not less 
By turning out the legislators every 12 years -- or even worse, every six years -- you pretty much guarantee that those who are elected wo n't have much of a stake in their jobs 
legislators will use legislators as temporary hitching posts on legislators way to other offices without term limitations 
Not every state lawmaker has his eye on a seat in the U.S. Senate or House of Representatives 
But a safe bet that more people will be using state seats to groom for higher office if they know that the law will force them out soon's a safe bet that more people will be using state seats to groom for higher office if they know that the law will force them out soon 
Lobbyists, of course, will rejoice 
highly paid lobbyists influence over these legislative birds of passage will grow because highly paid lobbyists will be guaranteed a perennial crop of callow and ignorant lawmakers 
One thing that legislators now have going for legislators is that legislators can become conversant with public issues and so challenge, if legislators care to, the self-serving propaganda of the special interests 
Celebrating, along with the lobbyists, will be the legislative staffs whose tenure would be unaffected 
These unelected officials are permanent and beyond the reach of voters, while the very people who are in some measure accountable will be hustled out of office 
Ultimately, what the term limit amounts to is an indictment of citizenship 
the term limit is an admission that the voters are civic imbeciles who can not discriminate between bad lawmakers and good ones 
Where surgical strikes are needed to eliminate the incompetent or corrupt, the term limitation uses carpet bombing in the hope that in the resulting carnage, some of the guilty will suffer along with the innocent 
At the most basic level, term limitation is just flat-out wrongheaded and illogical : To throw everybody out when all you want to do is throw out the rascals is like burning down your house in order to get rid of the rats
