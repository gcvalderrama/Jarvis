Freshman congressman Larkin Smith (R-Miss )
died in a light plane crash in Mississippi , authorities said Monday , making Freshman congressman Larkin Smith (R-Miss ) the second member of the House killed in an aviation accident in a week 
The single-engine Cessna 177 crashed Sunday night in thick woods near the tiny community of Janice 
Smith and the pilot , Charles Vierling , who also was killed , were flying from Hattiesburg to Gulfport , according to federal and local officials 
Searchers combed the heavily wooded DeSoto National Forest through the night but were unable to find the wreckage until Monday morning , when Searchers  spotted the heavily wooded DeSoto National Forest  from the air 
There was a 300-foot-long path cut by the plane , Harrison County Sheriff's Department Capt. Rick Gaston said in a telephone interview 
Smith , 45 , died the same day the wreckage of a plane carrying Rep. Mickey Leland (D-Tex )
and 15 others was found on an Ethiopian mountainside 
Leland's plane had been missing almost a week after Rep. Mickey Leland (D-Tex ) took off on a fact-finding mission to combat hunger 
News of Smith's death was followed by an outpouring of sympathy from Mississippi to Washington , even as Smith's colleagues were still mourning Leland's death 
At the White House , spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said President and Mrs. Bush deeply regret Smith's death , adding that Smith , who was elected to a seat vacated by Sen. Trent Lott (R-Miss )
, was just beginning a promising career in the Congress 
Smith , a former sheriff and police chief , was already developing a reputation on the House Judiciary Committee as a zealous opponent of illegal drugs 
Smith , a former sheriff and police chief  (the congressional delegation )had come to depend on Smith  in the fight against drugs , said Rep. G. V. (Sonny )Montgomery (D-Miss )
This is a tremendous loss to his family , his state , and the nation 
Smith had thrown out the first ball at the Dixie Youth World Series baseball tournament Sunday and was heading home to Gulfport , taking off at about 9:10 p.m. for the 35-minute flight 
Jack Barker , a Federal Aviation Administration spokesman here , said the plane lost radar contact at 9:25 
Jack Barker  said area residents heard the airplane crash and notified officials 
Barker said visibility was 4 to 6 miles , and rain was reported , but not heavy 
Lamar Breland told the Associated Press that Lamar Breland  wife was preparing to go to bed , and area residents  heard a plane coming over 
Lamar Breland  thought at the time the Associated Press  was unusual for a plane to be in the area at night 
Lamar Breland  said Lamar Breland  heard a revving sound and then a crash 
In Miami , Jorge Prellezo , regional director of the National Transportation Safety Board , said a team of investigators had been dispatched to the scene 
Investigators generally take months to establish a probable cause of such incidents 
The plane belonged to the Institute for Marine Mammal Studies Inc. in Gulfport 
The institute immediately issued a statement saying that Smith had requested use of the plane to accommodate Smith  busy schedule 
Jody Canady , a spokeswoman , said Smith was to reimburse the institute 
The statement said the plane , manufactured in 1973 , and purchased by the institute last year , had a current inspection 
The pilot received the pilot  license in 1964 and had a physical examination on June 28 , the statement said 
Smith was elected last November to represent Mississippi's 5th congressional district 
Smith  was Harrison County Sheriff from 1984 to 1989 , and was Gulfport police chief from 1977 to 1983 
As sheriff , Smith coordinated anti-drug efforts of federal , local and state agencies across five states 
Smith , survived by a wife and one child , was lauded by Mississippi Gov. Ray Mabus , who called Smith  death a tragic loss for the state and ordered flags on state property flown at half staff 
Friends and former associates in Gulfport were stunned and saddened 
Gaston , who worked for Smith nine years both in the sheriff's department and earlier when Smith was Gulfport police chief , called Smith a pillar of strength 
Harrison County Sheriff's Department Capt. Rick Gaston  was progressive , and above all , honest 
You just never thought something like this would happen
