Doctors Wednesday reported a growing number of stress-related illnesses among people in a resort city southwest of Tokyo that has been jolted by thousands of tremors and several volcanic eruptions in the past two weeks . 
`` [We(PRP)| Doctors(NNS)] 've had an increasing number of patients complaining of insomnia and gastritis due to stress and fear of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions , '' said Mikio Kakefu , director of the National Hospital in Ito City . 
Ito , a coastal resort city on the Izu peninsula , about 60 miles southwest of Tokyo , has had more than 23,000 temblors , including 486 strong enough to be felt , since June 30 . 
On July 13 , an undersea volcano erupted off the Ito coast , creating a mound 82 feet high , according to the Maritime Safety Agency , Japan 's coast guard . 
Volcanic activity has slowed since then , and no strong earthquakes have been recorded since Sunday . 
No injuries or damages were reported after the eruption . 
But the Central Meteorological Agency has warned the volcano is likely to erupt again because the movement of magma , or molten rock , continues . 
Kakefu said the hospital , which has an average of 250 outpatients daily , Monday began receiving more patients with stomach aches , insomnia and diarrhea , `` all from fear and stress . '' 
`` [They(PRP)| 250 outpatients daily(NNS)] did n't feel sick for a couple of days after the eruption because [they(PRP)| 250 outpatients daily(NNS)] were still tense , '' [he(PRP)| Mikio Kakefu(NNP)] said . 
Kakefu said [he(PRP)| Mikio Kakefu(NNP)] does not have any statistics , but indicated the number of such patients is likely to increase . 
Pets have also been developing similar symptoms since shortly after the eruption , said Masaaki Mochizuki , an Ito veterinarian . 
[He(PRP)| Masaaki Mochizuki(NNP)] said [he(PRP)| Masaaki Mochizuki(NNP)] has examined 129 cats and dogs suffering the `` earthquake syndrome '' between July 4 and July 14 . 
Symptoms such as nausea , diarrhea and loss of appetite were frequent among cats , and many dogs suffered skin problems including rashes and hair loss , [he(PRP)| Masaaki Mochizuki(NNP)] said . 
[He(PRP)| Masaaki Mochizuki(NNP)] said some dogs were also afflicted with coughing and trembling due to excessive fear . 
`` [My(PRP$)| Masaaki Mochizuki(NNP)] busiest day was July 14 , the day after the eruption , '' Mochizuki said . 
`` Symptoms in animals appeared earlier than in people because animals are more sensitive , and [they(PRP)| people in a resort city southwest of Tokyo(NNS)] feel the temblors and noises more strongly . '' 
`` [We(PRP)| people in a resort city southwest of Tokyo(NNS)] humans have information from the municipal office and the meteorological centers , which help to relieve [our(PRP$)| people in a resort city southwest of Tokyo(NNS)] tensions ... but such things do n't work for animals , '' [he(PRP)| Masaaki Mochizuki(NNP)] said .
