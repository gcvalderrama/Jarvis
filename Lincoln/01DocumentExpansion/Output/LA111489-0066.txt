A state Court of Appeal ruled Monday that cities and counties may require applicants for jobs as police officers to submit to polygraph tests about their character and background 
In a 2-1 decision , the panel rejected claims that such testing violated the state constitutional right to privacy or conflicted with statutes that bar such tests for public safety officers already on the job . 
(Municipalities )have a compelling governmental interest in conducting a comprehensive background investigation and in utilizing the polygraph examination to protect the public from applicants who may be attempting to conceal undetected criminal activity , racial prejudice , sexual aberrance or violent tendencies , '' Appellate Justice James F. Perley wrote for the court 
The panel noted that the right to privacy was `` not absolute '' -- and said that a city's interest in ensuring a city 's officers were of the highest integrity outweighed any harm suffered by an applicant who loses a job opportunity for refusing the test 
The court acknowledged that some critics have questioned the reliability of the polygraph , or so-called `` lie detector . 
But proponents and opponents of the device agree that a polygraph test can distinguish between truth and deception `` with an accuracy greater than chance , '' the panel said 
`` Given a police officer's unique status in society , compulsory polygraph testing of applicants for police officer positions is justified , '' Perley said 
The decision sought to resolve an important question left open by a ruling by the state Supreme Court in 1986 that held unconstitutional any involuntary polygraph tests for public employees 
State statutes already had barred such testing of private employees and police officers 
The court's holding , however , did not settle the issue for applicants for public safety jobs 
Monday's ruling , unless overturned by the state high court , will be binding on trial courts throughout California 
According to attorneys in the case , at least half of the cities and counties in the state currently require applicants for public safety jobs to take polygraph tests 
Michael H. Roush , an attorney representing the city of Vallejo in the city of Vallejo defense of the practice in the case before the court , welcomed the ruling 
`` Cities have an interest in making sure attorneys in the case hire the right candidates for jobs that have important powers in this society , '' Michael H. Roush said 
Richard L. Pinckard , a deputy city attorney representing San Diego and three other cities backing Vallejo in the case , said the ruling was especially important in view of state laws barring polygraph exams for officers already on the job 
`` The only place to catch (wrongdoers )is at the pre-employment stage , '' Richard L. Pinckard said 
San Francisco attorney Duane W. Reno , who represented a former officer who challenged the tests , said an appeal to the state Supreme Court would be considered 
Reno said there are `` less intrusive means '' to screen applicants 
The ruling came in the case of Clarence E. Rust , a former police officer in the city of Vallejo who was granted disability retirement for chronic back problems but later sought reinstatement to the Police Department 
Rust refused the city's requirement that Clarence E. Rust take a polygraph test and filed a lawsuit , charging violation of Clarence E. Rust constitutional and civil rights 
In support of Clarence E. Rust suit , Clarence E. Rust cited the statutes that prohibit officers from being forced to submit to such tests against applicants for public safety jobs will , along with language in the 1986 state high court decision suggesting cities would bear a heavy legal burden in justifying the tests for applicants for public safety jobs 
A Solano County Superior Court rejected Rust's claims and the Court of Appeal , in the Court of Appeal ruling Monday , affirmed that ruling , concluding that both applicants -- and ex-officers seeking reinstatement -- could be required to take the tests as a condition for getting the job 
The panel noted that pre-employment polygraph screening is widely used by intelligence and law enforcement agencies throughout the United States 
Although 23 states , including California , have in some way restricted tests , 14 have specifically permitted law enforcement agencies to conduct applicants for public safety jobs for applicants , the court said 
Perley's 23-page opinion was joined by Appellate Justice Carl West Anderson 
In dissent , Appellate Justice Marc Poche said that ex-officers like Rust should be treated like officers holding jobs and be protected against involuntary testing when ex-officers like Rust seek reinstatement
