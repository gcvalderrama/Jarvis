Tetsuya Theodore Fujita saw his only natural tornado near Denver in 1982 
his only natural tornado  was like meeting Tetsuya Theodore Fujita  lover , Tetsuya Theodore Fujita  says 
Since then , Tetsuya Theodore Fujita  passion really went up , said Fujita , a professor of geophysical science who has been studying tornadoes for 42 years and is considered one of the world's foremost authorities on the violent storms 
Fujita , 69 , spends much of Tetsuya Theodore Fujita  time in Tetsuya Theodore Fujita  lab at the University of Chicago creating tornadoes for research 
Tetsuya Theodore Fujita  creates tornadoes over a large fan , which makes a swirling motion ; another fan above simulates a low-pressure system by adding an updraft to the mix 
With a bit of steam added to make the phenomenon visible , Tetsuya Theodore Fujita  creates twisters six to eight feet tall 
The miniature versions are as impossible to redirect or squelch as their full-size cousins , Tetsuya Theodore Fujita  says 
Tetsuya Theodore Fujita  has tried by crawling right up next to their full-size cousins  and using rulers or books to change their full-size cousins  direction 
Fujita came to the United States from Japan in 1953 , partly because there are so many tornadoes in this country 
Tornadoes are very rare in Japan , Fujita said 
their full-size cousins  have about 10 to 15 a year 
But one occurred within about 15 miles of my hometown 
Tetsuya Theodore Fujita  was quite impressed with the localized severity of the wind 
When Tetsuya Theodore Fujita  saw his first tornado , Tetsuya Theodore Fujita  and a team of scientists were studying wind shear and his first tornado  effect on aircraft 
his first tornado  is a beautiful thing , Fujita said 
Of course , Tetsuya Theodore Fujita  was 20 miles away from that one 
If you are in it , Tetsuya Theodore Fujita  added , it is a terrible thing 
Forecasters still have trouble predicting tornadoes 
But Fujita has helped define the conditions most likely to spawn Forecasters  
Groups of thunderstorms are not as likely to spawn tornadoes as single , large storms because multiple storms in the same area compete 
Each one tries to rotate , but Groups of thunderstorms  all ca not 
Groups of thunderstorms  are just like human beings : The rich may become richer and the poor may get poorer 
Fujita also discovered that most strong tornadoes are actually six or seven small twisters Tetsuya Theodore Fujita  calls suction vortices , rotating around the center of a larger tornado 
A suction vortex can pick up a car or a small house or something , but when you are standing right next to A suction vortex  you can be completely safe 
He has studied tornadoes that have dropped houses into lakes , made off with one car and left another right next to one car  untouched , and moved whole flocks of cows and sheep which lived through the experience 
He also developed the Fujita scale for measuring the strength of tornadoes 
the Fujita scale  runs from zero a tornado that might break twigs on trees to five a twister that can rip houses from their foundations 
But Fujita considers Tetsuya Theodore Fujita  work on other air movements called downbursts and microbursts among Tetsuya Theodore Fujita  most significant achievements 
Downbursts are powerful drafts of air moving down from a thunderstorm cloud 
Scientists long thought the drafts dissipated before reaching the ground 
Microbursts are smaller versions of downbursts , but are more dangerous because Microbursts  give pilots less time to react , Fujita said 
The National Transportation Safety Board has cited microbursts , a term coined by Fujita , as the cause of 17 aircraft accidents in the last 15 years , causing 577 fatalities 
Among Microbursts  was the 1985 crash of a Delta L-1011 in Dallas that killed 137 people 
A downburst also was implicated in the collapse of a wall at a school in Newburgh , N.Y. , that killed nine children 
Fujita's work helped persuade the Federal Aviation Administation to begin installing a new radar system at 47 major airports beginning in the early 1990s 
The Doppler radar system was credited with helping three jetliners at Denver's airport avoid potentially catastrophic microbursts last year 
Fujita retires from teaching this year , but will continue Tetsuya Theodore Fujita  research at the university 
In Texas one time , five people were killed when five people  drove right into a tornado 
five people  just did not know any better , Fujita said 
Tetsuya Theodore Fujita  want to make people safer
