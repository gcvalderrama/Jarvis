Forecasters preparing for Thursday's opening of the Atlantic hurricane season wish they could predict the arrival of new technological help they say may be crucial to ever-growing coastal populations 
The Air Force has agreed to fly hurricane reconnaissance flights for two more years, but has made The Air Force clear The Air Force plans to phase out the missions 
And only one satellite is available for tracking hurricanes 
" Forecasters preparing for Thursday's opening of the Atlantic hurricane season wish they could predict the arrival of new technological help they say just have nothing right now to lean on, " says Ken McKinnon, a spokesman for U.S. Rep. Tom Lewis of North Palm Beach, Fla., who has introduced a bill in Congress to keep hurricane hunters flying at least another five years 
" Forecasters preparing for Thursday's opening of the Atlantic hurricane season wish they could predict the arrival of new technological help they say 've got one satellite and hurricane hunters 're telling Forecasters preparing for Thursday's opening of the Atlantic hurricane season wish they could predict the arrival of new technological help they say one satellite 'll do the job 
If one satellite blinks, how do you track weather ? 
The Air Force does n't want to be involved 
" We have in the last few years examined our need for manned weather reconnaissance and feel there's no real compelling military reason, " said spokesman Lt. Col. Darrell Hayes 
" We 're not disputing that the hurricane center and the weather service need the data 
We 're just saying there may be more appropriate agencies to provide the information, " Lt. Col. Darrell Hayes said, adding that the service had approached the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration about taking over the flights 
Besides the flights, forecasters depend on radar and satellite data 
The single working weather satellite was n't intended to be alone 
A second satellite failed, and a replacement for the failed craft was blown up in a mishap on the launch pad, forcing forecasters to make do 
There are new satellites on the horizon, says Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center 
But Bob Sheets 've been due for a long time and are n't expected before late 1990 
" a long time is a major concern for Forecasters preparing for Thursday's opening of the Atlantic hurricane season wish they could predict the arrival of new technological help they say, " Sheets said 
Forecasters also are worried about a shift in the pattern of hurricane activity in recent years 
Since 1985, Sheets said, there seem to be more hurricanes and Bob Sheets 're more likely to hit the United States 
" Bob Sheets may be in an upswing, " he said, " possibly back to the pattern of the '40s, '50s and '60s when Bob Sheets had a tremendous number of landfall hurricanes . 
Max Mayfield, hurricane specialist at the National Weather Service in Miami, said experts do n't known enough yet about hurricanes to tell if this is just a peak in activity, or a return to the 50s and 60s 
" Now experts can see past the Antilles out into the Atlantic, and over toward Hawaii on the west, " said forecaster Hal Gerrish 
" experts 'd like to be able to see all the way to Africa, " which is where Atlantic hurricanes develop, Hal Gerrish said 
The need for improved tracking systems is important because more and more people are moving to coastal locations likely to be affected by storms 
" Bob Sheets spoke to about 5,000 people on the west coast of Florida, " Sheets said 
" Ninety-plus percent of about 5,000 people were from the Midwest or Northeast and had just come to Florida 
about 5,000 people really have very little concept of what a hurricane is . 
During the average Atlantic hurricane season, which stretches from June through the end of November, six tropical storms will grow into hurricanes, with heavy rains and winds of 74 mph 
Donna, in 1960, struck the Florida Keys at Marathon, then raked across Naples and Fort Myers before weakening inland 
Last season, 505 people died in Atlantic hurricanes, including Gilbert and Joan 
Gilbert killed more than 300 people and did heavy damage in Mexico, Jamaica, Haiti and the Dominican Republic as it blasted across the the western Caribbean and part of the Gulf of Mexico _ including the Florida Keys, the Florida Straits and Cuba 
Joan hovered off the coast of Central America for days before howling in with top winds of 135 mph 
The storm caused mudslides, floods and other damage in Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Colombia and Panama
