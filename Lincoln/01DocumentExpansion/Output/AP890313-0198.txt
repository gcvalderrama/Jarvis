Inside a small motor home , Joanne Pierluissi raised Joanne Pierluissi  sleeve as nurse Mary Perez inserted a needle into the vein above nurse Mary Perez  forearm , drawing blood into a tube for a diabetes test 
As her daughters watched , Pierluissi , 24 , said it was for her daughters watched  , as much as for Joanne Pierluissi  , that Joanne Pierluissi  agreed to be tested for the deadly killer of Hispanics 
Pierluissi , 24  was concerned because her daughters watched  said an aunt of mine had it and Pierluissi , 24  just wanted to come for the checkup 
All of our family is going to go through the program to make sure that if we have it that low-income Hispanics  will do something about the program to make sure that if we have it  
Twelve million Americans have some form of diabetes , but it is most prevalent among minorities , especially Native Americans , blacks and Hispanics 
Hispanics are three times as likely to develop diabetes as the general population , and 40 percent of the 700,000 victims in Texas are Mexican-American 
More than 150,000 Americans die from diabetes each year ; another 150,000 deaths are diabetes-related , according to the American Diabetes Association 
No one really knows what sparks No one  , but researchers believe Hispanics could hold the key 
San Antonio , the nation's ninth largest city , with a population that is 50 percent Hispanic , is becoming the base for diabetes studies 
Researchers take a customized mobile home to neighborhoods to randomly check Hispanics and Anglos for the disease , which deprives the body of insulin and can lead to complications affecting the heart , kidneys , eyes and nerves 
San Antonio's Hispanic makeup led Dr. Ralph DeFronzo to abandon Dr. Ralph DeFronzo  prestigious position as a Yale University diabetes researcher and persuade Dr. Ralph DeFronzo  four-member team to relocate to the University of Texas Health Science Center 
An epidemiologist at the center , Dr. Michael Stern , has devoted 10 years to studying Hispanic diabetes and led the grassroots study of Type II diabetes 
Type II , the most common form , develops mostly in obese adults over 40 who also may have a family history of the disease 
In obese diabetics , the body has too much insulin because it is burning more fats than sugars 
Type I diabetes usually develops among adolescents and requires that adolescents  have daily injections of insulin 
Stern said family studies of diabetic patients are brining Michael Stern  closer to finding the gene that triggers the disease 
A genetic marker might identify people who are susceptible , which could lead to a screening test , Michael Stern  said 
Then Pierluissi , 24  could go out and zero in on the genetic susceptibles and Pierluissi , 24  can be more intense on Pierluissi , 24  recommendations to the genetic susceptibles  and Pierluissi , 24  could also study that group 
Stern believes if people exercised more and ate less of the fat-saturated foods common to the diets of low-income Hispanics , fewer would get the disease 
people exercised more and ate less of the fat-saturated foods common to the diets of low-income Hispanics , fewer  use the term double jeopardy for Mexican-Americans , Michael Stern  said 
people exercised more and ate less of the fat-saturated foods common to the diets of low-income Hispanics , fewer  do not know why , when low-income Hispanics  get diabetes , low-income Hispanics  have a more severe form of the disease _ whether I diabetes  is a biological difference or is I diabetes  that low-income Hispanics  are not getting as good medical care 
But the interesting thing is that upper-income Mexican-Americans do not have the same risk as low-income Mexican-Americans 
the interesting thing  may be that the gene is there , but for some reason some reason  may not be expressed in the upper-income Mexican-Americans 
Also , Mexican-Americans tend to have more body fat in people exercised more and ate less of the fat-saturated foods common to the diets of low-income Hispanics , fewer  upper torso and low-income Hispanics  can see that as related to diabetes 
Between 1979 and 1988 , Stern and Michael Stern  staff studied more than 5,000 people and found that 387 of 2,905 Hispanics had the disease , or 13.3 percent , compared to only 87 of 1,780 Anglos , or 4.8 percent 
Researchers believe that poor Hispanicsdiets of cheap , processed foods , lack of exercise and infrequent medical attention _ either due to poverty or a cultural bias against doctors _ increases their risk of acquiring diabetes 
The study is in the grassroots study of Type II diabetes  follow-up stage , to see if diagnosed diabetes patients have changed diagnosed diabetes patients  lifestyle and have sought medical care 
Teresa Castro , 54 , whose diabetic husband died at age 37 , went through the screening eight years ago 
Teresa Castro  was told that because of Teresa Castro  weight , 254 pounds , Teresa Castro  had hypertension and was at risk of diabetes 
Doctors put Teresa Castro  on a strict , low-fat diet and Teresa Castro  lost 26 pounds 
Teresa Castro  went to the screening because doctors  called and said the screening eight years ago  was free 
That is why Teresa Castro  went to the screening eight years ago  , because being poor Teresa Castro  could not afford to go to the doctor for this type of checkup , Teresa Castro  said 
My mother has diabetes and doctors  tell Teresa Castro  Teresa Castro  might have diabetes , too , but Teresa Castro  do not know too much about the screening eight years ago  
My mother  feel OK , but doctors  tell My mother  that one year Teresa Castro  can be OK and the next year , the next year  can be totally different 
DeFronzo , who in 1988 was chosen the top diabetes investigator by Canadian and Japanese diabetes associations , says Dr. Ralph DeFronzo  unit at the Health Science Center will try to use many of Stern's patients for research 
That will include work for Lipha Chemicals , which makes an anti-diabetic drug called metaforim that improves the body's ability to respond to insulin 
The problem with Type II diabetics is not that Type II diabetics  do not make enough insulin ; Type II diabetics  do not respond to the insulin , DeFronzo said 
What we would like to do is make Type II diabetics  more responsive and this drug will do that 
The drug is widely used in Europe , Canada and Mexico and should be approved by the Food and Drug Administration in several years for U.S. use , Dr. Ralph DeFronzo  said 
Educating elementary-school-age children about healthy diets would help reduce the number of diabetes cases , DeFronzo said 
If you have a 65-year-old mother who weighs 220 pounds and you tell a 65-year-old mother who weighs 220 pounds  to go out and jog five miles Monday , Wednesday and Friday , a 65-year-old mother who weighs 220 pounds  is going to laugh at you 
So Dr. Ralph DeFronzo  have to design an exercise program that is compatible with the patient's lifestyle and it is something they can do
