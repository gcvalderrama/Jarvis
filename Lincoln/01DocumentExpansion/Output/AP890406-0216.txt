The tanker Exxon Valdez was freed Wednesday from the reef that ripped [its(PRP$)| Valdez(NNP)] hull and spilled more than 10 million gallons of crude oil , and Alaska 's governor asked the Coast Guard to take over the cleanup from Exxon . 
Elsewhere , the captain of the Exxon Valdez surrendered to police and was ordered held on $ 1 million bond . 
Cleanup crews continued to skim mayonnaise-thick oil from Prince William Sound , but progress was slow and the oil had spread over an area larger than Delaware . 
The animal death toll rose and salmon hatcheries remained endangered . 
In Juneau , Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper said [he(PRP)| Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper(NNP)] asked Coast Guard Rear Adm. Edward Nelson Jr. to take over the much-maligned and slowly progressing cleanup effort from Exxon , and Nelson indicated [he(PRP)| Coast Guard Rear Adm. Edward Nelson Jr.(NNP)] would , although [he(PRP)| Coast Guard Rear Adm. Edward Nelson Jr.(NNP)] has not formally approved the request . 
Cowper said the Coast Guard should be better able to handle coordination and management of the cleanup than Exxon , which [he(PRP)| Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper(NNP)] said was too bureaucratic . 
`` Maybe that 's been the problem all along . 
You need a military system to get things done , '' the governor said . 
`` We appreciate the efforts of Exxon _ we think they were done in good faith . 
But we think there has to be a much more disciplined management structure , '' Cowper said at a Capitol news conference . 
President Bush earlier had sent a team of high-level officials to Valdez and determined that federal management of the cleanup was n't necessary . 
Cowper said Coast Guard management is different from the plan Bush rejected . 
Although Cowper said [he(PRP)| Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper(NNP)] did n't want to be `` extremely critical '' of Exxon , a letter sent to the Coast Guard by a state environmental official said Exxon had been unresponsive . 
`` Exxon has failed to provide ... the information necessary to make sound planning recommendations regarding the cleanup of oil and the protection of resources , '' wrote Lynn Kent , chief of the state Oil and Hazardous Substance Spill Response Section . 
Exxon spokesman Henry Beathard said the company disagreed with charges [it(PRP)| the company(NN)] was n't handling the cleanup properly and thought Exxon was the best organization to manage the effort . 
`` We gathered all the resources and organized the cleanup . 
We think the most effective and efficient way to carry out this project is -LRB- for Exxon -RRB- to continue , '' Beathard said . 
Fired tanker captain Joseph Hazelwood , 42 , surrendered to police on New York 's Long Island and a judge set bail at $ 1 million bond or $ 500,000 in cash , up from a prosecutor 's recommendation of $ 25,000 . 
[He(PRP)| Joseph Hazelwood(NNP)] had been sought since Saturday on a fugitive warrant on misdemeanor charges of operating the tanker while drunk . 
`` These misdemeanors are of such a magnitude that has never been equaled , at least in this country , '' Judge Kenneth Rohl said as Hazelwood was arraigned . 
`` [He(PRP)| Joseph Hazelwood(NNP)] 's got to think about that . 
We have a manmade destruction that has not been equaled , probably , since Hiroshima . '' 
Salvage crews pumped compressed air into the $ 125 million ship and floated [it(PRP)| the $ 125 million ship(NN)] off Bligh Reef , 25 miles from the port of Valdez . 
From there , [it(PRP)| the $ 125 million ship(NN)] began a 30-mile journey under the control of six tugs to a remote cove off Naked Island for temporary repairs , picking its way through scattered icebergs . 
`` No pollution was immediately visible . 
There 's a real good possibility -LRB- oil -RRB- sheen will show up , but [they(PRP)| crews pumped(NNS)] 're ready for [it(PRP)| a real good possibility -LRB- oil -RRB- sheen will show up(NN)] , '' Coast Guard spokesman Rick Meidt said . 
The ship was refloated at 10:35 a.m. , hours before the tide reached [its(PRP$)| the $ 125 million ship(NN)] peak Wednesday . 
`` [It(PRP)| the $ 125 million ship(NN)] was not just a stroke of good luck , '' said Gary Gorski , Exxon 's salvage coordinator . 
`` [It(PRP)| the $ 125 million ship(NN)] took a lot of hard work . '' 
Exxon Shipping Co. . 
President Frank Iarossi said the company has talked with dry docks in South Korea , Japan and Singapore about accepting the vessel after the temporary repairs are made . 
First choice is a Portland , Ore. , dry dock , Iarossi said , but Oregon officials have raised concerns about accepting the ship . 
Iarossi said the ship wo n't trail any pollution while [it(PRP)| the $ 125 million ship(NN)] is towed . 
Oil has floated over 2,600 square miles , soiled 800 miles of beach and killed thousands of animals , including at least 30 sea otters , officials said . 
`` Dozens of otters are dying before rescuers can get to [them(PRP)| rescuers(NNS)] , '' said fish and game spokesman Jon Lyman . 
Favorable weather , however , has kept it offshore from a national park and additional coastline outside Prince William Sound . 
Flow through the Alaskan pipeline returned to [its(PRP$)| Flow through the Alaskan pipeline(NN)] normal daily flow of 2.1 million barrels Wednesday , the Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. said . 
Oil flow from the North Slope had been cut by 60 percent because the spill restricted tanker traffic in Valdez harbor , but traffic has increased . 
In Washington , Sen. Alan Cranston and Rep. Mel Levine accused the federal government of covering up the possibility of a major spill and the ineffectiveness of cleanup technology . 
The California Democrats also asked President Bush to cancel oil leasing off the California coast pending a review of the program . 
Hazelwood turned [himself(PRP)| Joseph Hazelwood(NNP)] in with three attorneys in Hauppauge , N.Y. , and was arraigned . 
His lawyer said [he(PRP)| His lawyer(NN)] had not decided whether to waive extradition proceedings and return to Alaska to face the charges . 
Hazelwood is charged with operating a ship while under the influence of alcohol , reckless endangerment and negligent discharge of oil . 
The charges carry a combined maximum penalty of 2 \ years in prison and a $ 10,000 fine . 
FBI officials in Washington say [they(PRP)| FBI officials in Washington(NNS)] also are investigating whether Hazelwood could be charged with felony violations of the Clean Water Act , which prohibits negligent discharge of pollutants into navigable waters . 
Hazelwood was fired by Exxon a week ago after the National Transportation Safety Board said tests taken about nine hours after the disaster showed [he(PRP)| Joseph Hazelwood(NNP)] was drunk . 
Hazelwood had been arrested twice for drunken driving and had [his(PRP$)| Joseph Hazelwood(NNP)] license suspended three times . 
His mother has told The Associated Press that her son had undergone rehabilitation and that Exxon was aware of [his(PRP$)| her son(NN)] drinking problem . 
Exxon said [it(PRP)| Exxon(NNP)] has changed [its(PRP$)| Exxon(NNP)] policy because of the spill and now requires crews to be aboard ship , where drinking is prohibited , four hours before sailing . 
One hundred claims have been filed with the company for damages , including 40 on Tuesday alone . 
The claims have come mostly from fishermen . 
Exxon has settled only two so far . 
At least 14 lawsuits have been filed .
