Michael Dukakis ' long-time support for tighter government controls on handguns provided ample ammunition for George Bush and the National Rifle Asociation . 
Dukakis , who supports a federal seven-day waiting period on handgun purchases and a ban on `` Saturday Night Specials , '' accused [his(PRP$)| Mike Dukakis going to take the guns away from you(NNP)] opponent of distorting [his(PRP$)| Mike Dukakis going to take the guns away from you(NNP)] stance on gun control . 
`` [I(PRP)| the Democrat(NNP)] 've always supported the right of hunters and sportsmen to own weapons and -LRB- for -RRB- people to protect [themselves(PRP)| people(NNS)] in [their(PRP$)| people(NNS)] own homes , '' the Democrat said . 
Dukakis backed the so-called Brady amendment to impose a uniform , mandatory seven-day waiting period on handgun purchases in all states . 
Bush opposed the Brady amendment , which went down to a 228-182 defeat Sept. 13 after intense lobbying by the NRA . 
Bush , a lifetime member of the NRA , elicited cheers from crowds across the South and West whenever [he(PRP)| George Bush(NNP)] declared [his(PRP$)| George Bush(NNP)] opposition to new federal gun controls . 
`` [I(PRP)| George Bush(NNP)] 'm a sportsman , [I(PRP)| George Bush(NNP)] 'm a hunter , -LRB- [I(PRP)| George Bush(NNP)] -RRB- like to do [it(PRP)| the NRA(NNP)] , and [I(PRP)| George Bush(NNP)] do n't believe we need the federal government going forward with gun control legislation , '' Bush told a rally in Billings , Mont. . 
In opposing a federal waiting period , Bush found [himself(PRP)| George Bush(NNP)] on the opposite side of several national police organizations , worried about the vagaries of state laws . 
Only 22 states now bar instant gun purchases . 
Dukakis vehemently denied ever telling a gun owners ' lobbyist , `` [I(PRP)| Mike Dukakis going to take the guns away from you(NNP)] do n't believe in people owning guns , only the police and military . 
And [I(PRP)| Mike Dukakis going to take the guns away from you(NNP)] am going to do everything [I(PRP)| Mike Dukakis going to take the guns away from you(NNP)] can to disarm this state . '' 
In 1976 , Dukakis supported a Massachusetts referendum to ban private ownership of handguns . 
The referendum failed . 
Dukakis currently favors the ban on Saturday Night Specials , as well as `` additional efforts to keep guns out of the hands of the criminally or mentally dangerous , including background checks . '' 
Dukakis boasts that as governor [he(PRP)| Mike Dukakis going to take the guns away from you(NNP)] supported a law setting a mandatory one-year prison sentence for those illegally carrying a gun , and stiffened penalties for felonies commited with a firearm . 
[He(PRP)| Mike Dukakis going to take the guns away from you(NNP)] says 22,000 Americans are killed each year with handguns . 
At one point the Dukakis campaign threatened a lawsuit against the NRA over ads berating the Democrat 's record on guns and crime . 
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen , D-Texas , long a favorite of the NRA , came to the defense of [his(PRP$)| Lloyd Bentsen(NNP)] running mate , saying , `` [I(PRP)| Lloyd Bentsen(NNP)] saw those ads about Mike Dukakis going to take the guns away from you . 
[I(PRP)| Lloyd Bentsen(NNP)] sure would n't be running with any fellow if [I(PRP)| Lloyd Bentsen(NNP)] thought [he(PRP)| Sen. Lloyd Bentsen(NNP)] was going to take [my(PRP$)| Lloyd Bentsen(NNP)] shotgun away from [me(PRP)| Lloyd Bentsen(NNP)] . '' 
Bush said [he(PRP)| George Bush(NNP)] supports `` mandatory sentences for those caught using a gun during a crime . '' 
But in a letter to the NRA , the Republican attacked what he called the `` gun control myths . '' 
`` Those who invent these myths threaten more than the rights of our 70 million gun owners and 25 million hunters , '' Bush said . 
`` Federal licensing , gun registration , background checks , or a ban on firearms to name a few , would only restrict the rights of the law-abiding , leaving criminals free to commit crimes with illegal weapons . '' 
Dukakis told a crowd in Pueblo , Colo. , that the charges [he(PRP)| Mike Dukakis going to take the guns away from you(NNP)] is against gun ownership are `` a lot of baloney . '' 
`` What [I(PRP)| Mike Dukakis going to take the guns away from you(NNP)] 'm concerned about is teen-agers in major cities of this country running around with Uzis and AK-47s -LRB- automatic military weapons -RRB- and killing people '' in street gangs and drug deals , Dukakis said . 
`` That 's the kind of thing that 's got to be controlled , not innocent sportsmen who have a perfect right to hunt . '' 
Bush , as a congressman from Houston , voted for the original federal Gun Control Act of 1968 . 
That law , enacted after the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. , barred convicted felons from buying or owning guns and banned interstate and mail-order sale of handguns . 
But Bush says [he(PRP)| George Bush(NNP)] also supported the 1986 McClure-Volkmer Act that allowed the interstate sale of rifles and shotguns . 
Bush , in [his(PRP$)| George Bush(NNP)] campaign literature , says , `` [I(PRP)| George Bush(NNP)] have always opposed federal gun registration or licensing of gun owners . '' 
But [he(PRP)| George Bush(NNP)] added , `` [We(PRP)| felons(NNS)] must balance the legitimate interests of gun owners with the rights of society . 
... [We(PRP)| felons(NNS)] must do all [we(PRP)| felons(NNS)] can to keep guns out of the hands of convicted criminals . '' 
In a debate with other Republican candidates before the Gun Owners of New Hampshire last Feb. 2 , Bush said , `` [I(PRP)| George Bush(NNP)] 'm not only a hunter but [I(PRP)| George Bush(NNP)] 'm a lifetime member of the NRA . 
[I(PRP)| George Bush(NNP)] do have a deep appreciation for the Second Amendment rights '' to keep and bear arms .
