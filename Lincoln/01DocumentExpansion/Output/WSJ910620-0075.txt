In response to questions about Mr. Sununu's recent shift to use of corporate jets in the wake of restrictions imposed last month on Mr. Sununu 's use of government planes , the White House released the list of five jets the chief of staff has used for travel to fund-raisers 
The identity of owners of two of the jets already had been publicized , and the others are not large national corporations 
White House counsel C. Boyden Gray's office approved all the travel in advance , and White House counsel C. Boyden Gray 's vetoed some suggested corporate jets because of potential conflicts of interest , White House officials said 
Use of corporate jets for political travel is legal provided the corporation is reimbursed for providing the ride or reports the travel as an `` in-kind '' political contribution 
Reimbursement for Mr. Sununu's travel often is made by the host of the political fund-raiser Mr. Sununu 's is attending 
The White House list said that on May 20 Mr. Sununu used a corporate jet provided by Donald Bryant , a benefits and insurance executive , to travel to a St. Louis fund-raiser for Missouri Gov. John Ashcroft 
On June 7 , Mr. Sununu used a jet provided by Fiber Materials Inc. of Biddeford , Maine , to travel to a fund-raiser for the Maine Republican party 
Mr. Sununu used a jet provided by three individual owners -- identified by the White House as Howard Bender , Martin Bender and John Mason -- to travel to a Chicago fund-raiser June 11 
The next day , as previously reported , Mr. Sununu used a jet provided by Beneficial Corp. , a financial management and planning concern , to return from a fund-raiser for the New Jersey state party 
Mr. Sununu 's had taken Mr. Sununu 's White House limousine to reach nearby New York to attend a stamp auction before that event 
And , as also previously disclosed , Mr. Sununu used a jet provided by KVI , an Iowa insurance brokerage firm , to travel Tuesday to a fund-raiser in Des Moines 
Mr. Sununu has resorted to regular use of corporate planes for political travel in the wake of controversy over Mr. Sununu 's heavy use of costly government aircraft for political and personal travel in the past two years 
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that use of corporate planes for political purposes is a `` well-established practice '' that Mr. Sununu will continue 
President Bush rose to the defense of his embattled chief of staff , while also making clear President Bush is chagrined about the travel controversy 
The president said that Mr. Sununu is `` doing a first-class job '' and that there is a `` piling-on syndrome '' feeding the publicity about Mr. Sununu 's travel 
But Mr. Bush , who spoke to reporters before a White House meeting as Mr. Sununu sat nearby , also seemed to suggest that President Bush would like President Bush chief of staff to avoid creating new travel controversies 
`` President Bush think when The president have an appearance problem , President Bush think all of us would agree The president want to try to avoid an appearance problem as much as possible , and President Bush think all of us have , '' President Bush said
