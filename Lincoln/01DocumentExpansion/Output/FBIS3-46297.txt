Language : Chinese Article Type : BFN -LSB- `` Random Notes on Hong Kong '' by Zhong Yan (6988 1693 ): `` Confession by the Last Governor of Hong Kong '' -RSB- -LSB- Text -RSB- Recently , Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten published an article entitled `` Go Against the North Wind . 
The meaning is quite clear : To go against China through to the end on the Hong Kong issue 
Why has Chris Patten no scruples about declaring Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten stand of going against China through to the end 
Just as Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten said in his article , the reason is that what Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten has done since Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten became governor of Hong Kong has been criticized and condemned not only by China and people of Hong Kong , but also by people in Britain 
Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten said : `` Some criticisms have appeared in both Britain and Hong Kong . 
But Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten also found excuses to console Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten : `` In an open and free society , such criticisms may appear . 
As a mater of fact , if there had only been `` some '' criticisms , there was no need for the governor to personally write such a long article to explain himself over such trifles 
The most important point of the article is that Chris Patten was trying hard to explain that all Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten had done was in the interests of the Hong Kong people 
Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten wrote : `` Our responsibility toward the citizens of Hong Kong should be put first . 
This British Hong Kong governor is really more concerned about Hong Kong than the Hong Kong people 
For this reason , This British Hong Kong governor feels the reason unfair that the Hong Kong people are criticizing and condemning This British Hong Kong governor instead of saying thank you to This British Hong Kong governor 
But for the Hong Kong people , of course the Hong Kong Chinese , what should be put first is certainly that the Hong Kong people should be treated as real Chinese people of China rather than a conquered people in a colony , and the first responsibility of Britain is to ensure a smooth return of Hong Kong to China in accordance with the Sino-British Joint Declaration 
In fact , responsibility toward the citizens of Hong Kong advocated by Chris Patten is actually for the colonialist interests of the British Empire 
Some people criticized what Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten had done as `` jeopardizing more extensive Sino-British relations . 
To refute this criticism Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten said : `` Hong Kong is the biggest and most important component part of these relations . 
What is more , `` judging from a long-term point of view , Some people position in China and Asia may , to a great extent , be decided by how Some people discharge Some people responsibility in Hong Kong in a dignified manner . 
People can not but ask : Why is Hong Kong the biggest and most important part of Sino-British relations 
To the Chinese people , the following is understandable : Hong Kong was plundered after the Opium War , a war of aggression launched by Britain against China 
The Chinese people will never forget this national humiliation 
If this humiliation is not wiped out , there can be no harmonious Sino - British relations 
However , this is obviously not what Chris Patten meant 
Then what did Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten mean by saying Hong Kong is the `` biggest and most important '' part of Sino-British relations 
Did Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten mean that the British Empire will not resign the British Empire to the return of its richest colony to China , the rightful owner 
People will also ask : Why will the position of Britain in China and Asia be decided by how Britain discharges Britain responsibility in Hong Kong in a dignified manner 
What position does Britain want to have in China and in Asia 
What is the meaning of a `` dignified manner '' 
If Britain ensures a smooth return of Hong Kong to China in accordance with the Sino-British Joint Declaration , is Britain not a practice in a `` dignified manner ? 
Can Britain not help improve the image of Britain and increase Britain position in China and Asia 
Does Britain really want to return Hong Kong to China only in name while preserving Hong Kong to China position as the `` governor '' to show the power and prestige of the British Empire and go on playing the tyrant in China and Asia as a colonialist 
In this respect , what Chris Patten meant is quite clear 
In Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten article , Chris Patten brutally attacked China as a `` villain . 
In fact , this is the right word for Mr. Patten himself 
Mr. Patten himself threatened that if China did not obey the `` governor's '' arrangement , China should not expect Britain would agree to China return to GATT 
Although Chris Patten has taken great pains to protect the interests of the British Empire , Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten is not admired by some domestic opinion 
Instead , Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten has been criticized and condemned 
That is why Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten feels somewhat wronged 
Chris Patten , the last governor of Hong Kong , has been trying hard to preserve an actual colonial position in Hong Kong and revitalize the colonialist power and prestige of the old British Empire 
Unfortunately , all this is but a day dream 
This article is actually a confession by Chris Patten , who has been driven to the wall , to prove Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten loyalty to British colonialism
