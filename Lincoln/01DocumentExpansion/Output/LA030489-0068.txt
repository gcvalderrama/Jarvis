A white Long Beach police officer who allegedly pushed a black man through a plate-glass window during an arrest that was secretly videotaped by a television crew acknowledged Friday that Officer made errors in Officer official report 
Officer Mark Dickey, speaking publicly for the first time since the Jan. 14 incident, told a state Senate oversight committee in sworn testimony that he had so little faith in his own report that Mark Dickey would not want the first time since the Jan. 14 incident used against Mark Dickey if Mark Dickey were suspected of a crime 
Mark Dickey blamed the discrepancies on a faulty memory, saying Mark Dickey wrote the report more than three hours after the altercation occurred 
Dickey, who was testifying under subpoena, admitted under questioning that the black man, Don Jackson, never used profanity during the arrest as Dickey had indicated in Mark Dickey report 
Dickey also admitted that Mark Dickey intended to inflict pain on Jackson when Don Jackson put handcuffs on Don Jackson as a way to control Don Jackson 
Police Misconduct Allegations Sen. Daniel Boatwright (D-Concord -RRB-, chairman of the Senate Select Committee on State Procurement and Expenditure Practices, called the hearing into the incident to review allegations of police misconduct in Long Beach 
The legislative committee monitors state funds disbursed to police departments by the state Police Officer Standards and Training Commission 
The incident received nationwide attention after a camera hidden in Jackson's car videotaped the arrest, during which Dickey swore at Jackson after stopping Mark Dickey car for an alleged traffic violation and then appeared to push Mark Dickey head through a plate-glass window 
Jackson, a Hawthorne police sergeant on disability leave and a self-styled crusader against police brutality, had gone to Long Beach that night with an NBC television crew following in a separate vehicle in what Don Jackson termed a " sting " operation to validate reports of racism and brutality by Long Beach police officers 
Investigations have been launched by the FBI, the Los Angeles County district attorney's office and the Long Beach Police Department 
Dickey has been temporarily reassigned to a desk job, and Jackson was charged with interfering with a police officer 
At the hearing, Boatwright repeatedly played the videotape while committee members and about 50 observers watched on television monitors and Dickey and Jackson commented on each scene 
Boatwright questioned whether the car in which Jackson was riding was actually weaving -- the stated cause for the traffic stop -- and whether Jackson acted aggressively toward the officers, as Dickey said in Mark Dickey report 
At one point, Boatwright asked Dickey : " You became the judge, jury and executioner as to whether Mark Dickey was challenged to a fight ? 
" No, " Dickey tersely replied 
Dickey's attorney, Michael Hannon, refused to allow Dickey to answer any more questions after nearly three hours of questioning because of what Mark Dickey called the " hostile and badgering " nature of the inquiry 
" This little kangaroo court gives these politicians a chance to run for office 
Any resemblance between this and a fair hearing is just imaginary, " Hannon told reporters afterward 
" They are taking stuff out of context and just badgering Dickey's attorney , Michael Hannon with a fair hearing . 
Earlier, under questioning by Boatwright and as the videotape was played, Dickey testified that the alleged infraction for which the Jackson car was stopped -- crossing the center divider -- occurred before the alleged infraction for which the Jackson car was stopped -- crossing the center divider -- could be seen on a tape shot from the NBC chase vehicle, but Police Misconduct Allegations Sen. Daniel Boatwright -LRB- D-Concord -RRB- , chairman of the Senate Select Committee on State Procurement and Expenditure Practices maintained that the tape does show Jackson's car weaving slowly within the traffic lane 
Boatwright, standing in front of the television monitor, pointed out that a videotape shot from the Jackson car's rear window shows the street lights passing by in a consistent pattern -- indicating the car was not weaving 
Dickey acknowledged that the police car he was driving " was weaving all over, too " as the police car he was driving tailed Jackson's car 
Jackson, also testifying under subpoena, said that he and Jeff Hill, an off-duty federal corrections officer who drove the car, took great care not to break traffic laws when they cruised along Pacific Coast Highway in Long Beach 
Don Jackson alleged that in addition to pushing his face into the glass, Dickey hurt Don Jackson by bending Don Jackson fingers while handcuffing Don Jackson and pushed Don Jackson face into the hood of the police car 
Also, Jackson alleged, officers refused three requests to loosen his handcuffs as Don Jackson was taken to the police station 
Dickey's eight-page police report, which was provided to reporters, states that Jackson was arrested for saying " offensive words, " an allegation that was later dropped 
But Dickey conceded at the hearing that it was he, not Jackson, who uttered obscenities 
No Taunts Heard The report states that Jackson challenged the officer to fight, although Jackson never is heard taunting the officer on the tape 
" There can be a fight without a verbal challenge, " Dickey said, adding that Jackson's fists were clenched at Don Jackson sides 
Dickey said that Mark Dickey was swearing to try to alleviate Mark Dickey fear 
Mark Dickey testified that Mark Dickey thought Jackson, who immediately stepped out of the car after the Jackson car came to a halt, might be trying to provide a diversion for an armed partner in the car 
Mark Dickey said Mark Dickey actions were an attempt to " accomplish Mark Dickey No. 1 job that night : to go home in one piece . 
At one point in the proceeding, Boatwright had Dickey and Jackson weighed in an attempt to show that Jackson is shorter and weighs less than the officer 
At another point, Boatwright assumed the role of Dickey and had Dickey play Jackson in trying to demonstrate the type of hold Dickey used on Jackson during the arrest 
Boatwright contended that in using that type of hold the officer would have had to push Jackson into the window deliberately 
Dickey denied the type of hold Dickey used on Jackson during the arrest 
The officer said Jackson's face crashed through the window when Jackson suddenly pulled forward 
Jackson, according to Dickey, struck the window with Don Jackson elbows and not with Don Jackson face as Jackson contends 
Dickey, who cut Mark Dickey hand, noted that Jackson suffered no facial injuries when the glass shattered 
Jackson, in Don Jackson testimony, defended Don Jackson self-appointed role as a police anti-brutality activist, saying " Don Jackson duty is to uphold the law and Don Jackson am doing that in the highest tradition . 
Don Jackson said Don Jackson is troubled, though, that Long Beach police are investigating Don Jackson background on the Hawthorne Police Department rather than concentrating on the incident 
Boatwright adjourned the hearing, which was held at the Hall of Administration in downtown Los Angeles, after about six hours of testimony 
Police Misconduct Allegations Sen. Daniel Boatwright -LRB- D-Concord -RRB- , chairman of the Senate Select Committee on State Procurement and Expenditure Practices said the hearing would reconvene later to hear from the additional witnesses
