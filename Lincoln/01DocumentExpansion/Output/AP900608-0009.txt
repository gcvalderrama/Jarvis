Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton secured a solid majority to win Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton sixth straight Democratic nomination 
But , like a boxing champion who slipped by on points , a boxing champion who slipped by on points is being asked to explain the lack of a knockout punch 
Clinton , 43 , was the nation's youngest governor when first elected in 1978 and Bill Clinton has had a stranglehold on the state's Democratic Party ever since 
But in last week's primary , Bill Clinton garnered just 55 percent of the vote while Tom McRae , an unpolished campaigner who heads a public policy think tank , earned 39 percent 
Four also-rans divided the rest 
Clinton , who toyed with the idea of running for the presidency in 1988 and already is talking about 1996 , said Bill Clinton saw no cause for concern in the margin of Bill Clinton primary victory 
`` Bill Clinton did n't see how Bill Clinton could get 60 percent , knowing the number of people who were saying in the surveys that they thought Bill Clinton was a good governor but were concerned about the tenure issue , '' Clinton said recently 
Tenure was summed up repeatedly by McRae as `` 10 years is long enough . 
Arkansans grow bored with their politicians sooner than voters elsewhere , Clinton said , in part because politics in the state is so personal 
Pumping hands at shopping malls and crawfish festivals is considered as important as running the right television ad 
`` Bill Clinton 'm just trying to tell people that in business they would n't fire a 43-year-old with 10 years of experience who's doing a good job , '' Clinton said days before the primary 
Sheffield Nelson , who upset Rep. Tommy Robinson for the Republican gubernatorial nomination , already is jumping on the theme , saying `` Arkansas is ready for a change . 
Clinton , who has focused on improving the state's education system , counters by calling Sheffield Nelson the candidate of change 
`` Frankly , if you look at what Bill Clinton proposed , compared with the others , the state 's education system represents more change , '' Bill Clinton said 
`` Ten years is an asset , not a liability . 
Clinton lost Bill Clinton first re-election bid in 1980 to Republican Frank White , but won again in 1982 , 1984 and 1986 , when the gubernatorial term was changed to four years 
Bill Clinton has all but promised not to run for the White House in 1992 if re-elected this year 
Bill Clinton showing in this year's primary , largely in line with pre-election polls , was the first time since his political comeback in 1982 that Clinton got less than 60 percent of the primary vote 
`` Bill Paschall , a Little Rock political consultant 'm sure the governor would like to have made a better showing , but when you 're in office 10 years you have a lot of friends and a lot of enemies , '' said Bill Paschall , a Little Rock political consultant 
`` Bill Paschall , a Little Rock political consultant do n't think a better showing's a death blow that Bill Clinton made 55 (percent ), but a better showing shows Bill Clinton Bill Clinton has to work harder . 
While the biggest complaint against Clinton appears to be that Bill Clinton has been in office too long , the governor also has been accused of being more interested in Bill Clinton national ambitions than state concerns 
Clinton's recent troubles with the legislature also have been a sticking point 
Twice in 1989 Bill Clinton failed to win legislative approval for proposals to increase taxes 
Nelson , who hopes to paint Clinton as a tax-and-spend Democrat , said the primary election results show the governor is on the ropes 
`` Sheffield Nelson 'd say against an unknown who never held an office , Sheffield Nelson think that was low 
an office probably did make some bells go off in Bill Clinton head , '' Nelson said 
Clinton said Bill Clinton would have done better if a large number of traditional Democrats had n't crossed over to the GOP primary to vote against Robinson 
`` We did poorly in areas where Bill Clinton did not campaign ; where my supporters , in spite of my best interest , believed the polls and did n't work ; and where we did a poor job of telling the people what Bill Clinton had done that affected my supporters lives ; and where people knew there was an alternative but did n't know much about what the alternative was , '' Clinton said 
Betsey Wright , Clinton's former chief of staff , said the governor's supporters were complacent 
`` Bill Clinton is always perceived as being so strong that people find spite of my best interest difficult to believe in calls for such cohesion and tight energies , '' Betsey Wright said of the primary
