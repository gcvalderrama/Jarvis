Michael Milken , the fallen Drexel Burnham Lambert financier , is striking out on Michael Milken own 
But what is n't clear is whether loyal ex-colleagues will follow the Pied Piper of junk bonds to Michael Milken new firm _ and how long the venture will last with Milken facing a lengthy jail term 
Milken , 42 , resigned Thursday after 19 years at Drexel , where Michael Milken began a wildly successful career that helped reshape corporate America in the 1980s through the pioneering use of low-grade securities called junk bonds 
Milken , who made a reported $ 550 million in 1987 , said Michael Milken is forming a consulting firm to assist companies that want to raise money to start up , grow or stay in business 
But Michael Milken faces $ 1.85 billion in forfeitures of alleged illegal profits and a lengthy jail term if convicted on a 98-count fraud and racketeering indictment , the government's largest securities crime prosecution to date 
People involved in Milken's plans for the new firm , International Capital Assets Group , said Milken does not intend to raid Drexel's Beverly Hills , Calif. , junk bond division , which Michael Milken founded and ran until Michael Milken March indictment 
The principals in the new firm , which now has a handful of employees and a temporary Los Angeles office , are not going to be `` Drexel people , '' Milken associates said 
But Milken still commands tremendous loyalty among some key junk bond employees and Drexel clients , and no one is ruling out defections 
Milken associates did not release details on Michael Milken plans , including whether an affiliated brokerage would be formed 
A Drexel official , speaking on condition of anonymity , said the Wall Street giant does not anticipate conflicts with Milken's new firm because Milken 's new firm will not be in the brokerage business 
Under Drexel's still-to-be-approved settlement of civil insider trading and other fraud charges with the Securities and Exchange Commission , Drexel and Drexel 's still-to-be-approved settlement of civil insider trading and other fraud charges with the Securities and Exchange Commission employees are barred from doing business with Milken , directly or indirectly 
The Drexel official said the provision likely will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis , so some contact between the New York investment firm's clients and Milken may occur 
For instance , Milken may be able to refer clients to Drexel and vice versa but not receive any fees 
Milken's resignation ends the relationship between one of the most important financial players of the decade and the firm Michael Milken helped boost from a second-tier brokerage to the nation's fifth largest 
`` Michael Milken made many important contributions to Drexel Burnham , and Michael Milken resignation , although not unexpected , is a sad event , '' Drexel stated 
`` the New York investment firm 's clients wish Michael Milken well in Michael Milken new endeavor . 
Milken widely was credited with creating a $ 175 billion-a-year junk bond market 
Michael Milken pitchman sale of the bonds _ previously used mainly by companies with low credit ratings _ helped fuel the decade's corporate takeover mania by giving smaller companies and corporate raiders a tool for financing growth , mergers and takeovers 
But the federal government alleges Milken used Michael Milken powers through Drexel to engage in a range of securities crimes , including schemes with now-jailed stock speculator Ivan Boesky 
Michael Milken also is accused of insider trading in a separate SEC lawsuit 
No settlement has been reached and no trial scheduled in that case 
Milken had been on leave from Drexel since Michael Milken criminal indictment 
Michael Milken brother , Lowell , who also was charged in the case , announced Thursday Lowell was quitting the firm to return to practicing law 
`` Michael Milken am naturally disappointed to be forced to leave Drexel as part of the firm's settlement with the government , but Michael Milken look forward to the opportunity of helping people build companies , '' Michael Milken said in a statement 
Milken joined Drexel full-time in 1970 after graduating from the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School 
In 1978 , Michael Milken moved Drexel's junk bond division to Beverly Hills 
Milken's trial in federal court in Manhattan is set for next March 
Michael Milken is free under a $ 700 million bond package 
Lawyers close to the case indicated Milken's decision to resign was calculated 
By quitting , Milken pre-empts the firm's agreement with the SEC to dismiss Michael Milken once the settlement is approved by a federal judge 
With Milken's resignation , lawyers may argue that parts of the Drexel pact are moot and mount further challenges 
Lawyers also are expected to challenge the provision barring Drexel and Milken from doing business with the same clients
