BFN -LSB- `` Separate exclusive interviews '' with Lu Ping , director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council of the PRC , by unidentified Television Broadcasts Limited reporter and with Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten by Television Broadcasts Limited reporter Jenny Lam ; places and dates not given ; from the `` Lu Ping and Chris Patten '' special program -- Lu Ping and unidentified reporter speak in Mandarin ; Chris Patten and Lam speak in English -RSB- -LSB- Text -RSB- -LSB- Begin recording -RSB- -LSB- Lu -RSB- We feel that the British Hong Kong Government has closed the door on contact with the Preliminary Work Committee -LSB- PWC -RSB- too tight 
and Chris Patten '' special program -- Lu Ping feel there is no need to do so 
Therefore , under such circumstances , I , as vice chairman of the PWC , and the Governor of Hong Kong , who should be considered the head of Hong Kong's civil service , since he does not allow contacts between civil servants and the PWC , what is the basis for me , a member of the PWC , to have contacts with vice chairman of the PWC 
-LSB- sentence as heard -RSB- -LSB- Patten -RSB- I must say that like the overwhelming majority of people in Hong Kong , like a number of members of the PWC , I think a great pity is a great pity that and Chris Patten '' special program -- Lu Ping are , as a great pity were , communicating through television , rather than sitting down at the table talking to one another 
-LSB- end recording -RSB- -LSB- Anchorman Yuan Chi-wei -RSB- Good evening 
Lu Ping , director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the Chinese State Council , has been visiting Hong Kong in the capacity of secretary general and vice chairman of the PWC 
Though Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten said time and again that Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten by Television Broadcasts Limited reporter Jenny Lam is willing to meet Lu Ping at any time , Lu Ping has consistently refused to meet Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten by Television Broadcasts Limited reporter Jenny Lam 
However , Director Lu Ping and Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten granted separate exclusive interviews to the Information Department of Hong Kong Television Broadcasts Limited and expressed their opinions on some issues in dispute between China and Britain 
Lu Ping reiterated that one of the main reasons why the `` Lu refused to meet Chris Patten is that the British side barred civil servants from meeting the PWC 
But Patten responded by saying : -LSB- Begin recording -RSB- -LSB- Patten -RSB- I repeat we are not against giving information to the PWC 
But the PWC is China's creation , China's appointment 
The Joint Liaison Group is the result of an agreement enshrined in a treaty between Britain and China , which is supposed to be working in the interests of Hong Kong 
Why seek to replicate that if that is the purpose 
What we want to do is to ensure that China and Britain work in that cooperative spirit which the Joint Declaration commits us to 
-LSB- Lu -RSB- We have an old saying in China , which goes : `` Listen to his words and watch his deeds . 
You should take some action to prove that you are truly willing to cooperate with the Chinese side in solving these problems 
Only when this happens can we have a basis for talks 
That is why we now suggest establishing some contacts through various other channels 
-LSB- Patten -RSB- Here we are in a position in which we have got agreed channels between Hong Kong and China and Britain , agreed channels which , alas , have not been working terribly well 
People in Hong Kong , I think , scratch these people heads about why a position in which we have got agreed channels between Hong Kong and China and Britain is that after all these months , years we have not got an airport agreement , why we are not making more progress on things like the localization and adaptation of laws , why we have not got an agreement on the container terminal , and so on 
And I think it is imperative that we get the existing channels to work 
I am not against giving information to the PWC 
We give information to all sorts of groups 
-LSB- Lu -RSB- Initially , our economic subgroup made an appointment with the president of the Kowloon-Canton Railway -LSB- KCR -RSB- to tell us something about the company's development strategy 
The main reason we wanted to know its development strategy is to find out how The main reason we wanted to know its development strategy can dovetail with the mainland railway development strategy 
As far as we know , the existing railway planning in Hong Kong does not reflect consideration on how to connect with the mainland railway system 
They have a plan for stretching into the territory of Shenzhen via Huanggang ; but this will not work , because according to Shenzhen's plan , Huanggang will become an urban center of Shenzhen , which can not possibly have a railway cutting across Shenzhen 's plan 
In such a situation , the two sides should coordinate and cooperate with each other 
This is the very reason we invited the KCR president to explain this matter 
First , the KCR president agreed to come and the time and place were also fixed 
But just now we were told the KCR president was not coming 
The KCR president is not a civil servant ; the KCR president can not be counted as a civil servant 
If someone in the capacity of the Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation president is unwilling to have contacts with us , how can you convince us that the British side is willing to cooperate with the Chinese side in other fields 
-LSB- Patten -RSB- If Director Lu Ping had wanted to talk about infrastructure , I would have been delighted to do so 
We will shortly want to talk to the Chinese authorities about the outcome of our railway development strategy , which is absolutely vital to the communication links of Hong Kong in the future 
I am bound to say that the first I heard about a meeting with the head of the KCR was when I heard what Director Lu Ping had said , but I do not know any more details about the alleged KCR meeting 
-LSB- Lu -RSB- As I said , the Hong Kong Government's attitude toward the PWC is not exactly one of friendliness 
We once invited officials of the Hong Kong Government to the PWC to explain to us the draft regulations of the Airport Authority that they had put forward 
The main purpose of our invitation was that the PWC wished to help bring the airport talks to an early start and to an early agreement by discussing the draft regulations of the Airport Authority 
But after we read the regulations , we were not quite clear about some of them , about why they were written in certain ways , so we wished that the Hong Kong side could explain to us 
The main purpose was to promote the airport talks 
Very unfortunately , however , the Hong Kong side barred its civil servants from having contacts with us at the PWC 
-LSB- Patten -RSB- Because at the moment , we put enough burdens on the civil service , trying to get , for example , the existing channels to work better 
Civil servants also have to report to Legco -LSB- Legislative Council -RSB- , which is the body that represents the people of Hong Kong 
-LSB- Lu -RSB- As you know , to reach an agreement on any issue , the mutual understanding and accommodation that you mentioned is necessary 
Mutual understanding and accommodation means both of us give in a bit , after which our two sides can reach an agreement 
It will not work if only one side , one-way traffic -LSB- preceding three words in English -RSB- is relied on 
We have made concessions on many issues 
For example , on the financing arrangements for the airport , we have made big concessions 
-LSB- end recording -RSB- -LSB- Yuan -RSB- Lu Ping kept saying that because the present atmosphere is not good , it is not the right time to meet Chris Patten 
But Patten said that if the atmosphere is not good , the best thing to do is to sit down and talk , so as to improve the atmosphere 
But Lu Ping said one should be more realistic 
-LSB- Begin recording -RSB- -LSB- Lu -RSB- If we talk , we should talk in a cooperative atmosphere in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding on the New Airport 
The purpose of my meeting with the Governor of Hong Kong would mainly be to talk about how to achieve a smooth transition 
This requires a cooperative atmosphere and a basis on which our talks can yield some results 
If our talks can not bring any results , I do not think we should waste our time 
If the two of us talk for a long time and then meet you when we come out , you will ask us if we got anywhere after the long talk , and we will say we got nowhere 
This will be a big disappointment for the people of Hong Kong 
-LSB- Patten -RSB- He talked to you in the week about the atmosphere not being conducive to a meeting 
If you do not have a good atmosphere , the best thing to do is to have a meeting to try to make the atmosphere better 
I am absolutely sure that the overwhelming majority of people in Hong Kong who want us to meet and want us to talk these things through in a sensible and reasonable way will in due course have Hong Kong people ambitions met , because if we are serious about cooperation and the interests of Hong Kong , then we have got at some stage to sit round the table and then work things out together 
-LSB- Lu -RSB- I think we should be more realistic and the two sides should create a better atmosphere 
As far as we are concerned , the invitations we extended to the Hong Kong Government still stand 
The PWC's door is always open 
The question now is whether or not the Hong Kong Government is willing to open this door 
-LSB- Patten -RSB- the Foreign Exchange Fund is a body appointed by Chinese officials to advise Chinese officials 
Unlike the Joint Liaison Group , The Joint Liaison Group is not a result of an agreement between two sovereign powers , similarly the Land Commission , similarly the Airport Committee 
And unlike the Legislative Council , it is not a body which represents public opinion right across the board in Hong Kong 
-LSB- end recording -RSB- -LSB- Yuan -RSB- Coming up next is the second part of this program on how Lu Ping and Chris Patten look at the Xi Yang incident and whether or not the two of them will have a chance to meet each other in the future 
Stay with us 
-LSB- at this point program goes to commercial break -RSB- During our interviews with them , both Lu Ping and Chris Patten were asked about the Xi Yang incident 
Our reporter asked Lu Ping a question about the Xi Yang incident causing the people of Hong Kong to worry about the freedom of the press 
-LSB- Begin recording -RSB- -LSB- Lu -RSB- This is not the case 
Begin recording -RSB- -LSB- Lu has nothing to do with Hong Kong's freedom of the press whatsoever , because Xi Yang committed the crime within the territory of China 
Since Xi Yang crime was committed within China's territory , the crime was handled according to China's law 
China's law is of course not entirely the same as Hong Kong's law 
Perhaps , if Xi Yang had committed the crime in Hong Kong , the crime in Hong Kong could have been handled differently 
But Xi Yang committed the crime in China's territory 
No matter who you are , you must observe China's law when you are on the land of China 
China 's law does not apply to Hong Kong people only 
If a U.S. citizen commits a crime in China's territory , a crime in China 's territory will also be handled according to China's law 
This is perfectly justified 
So it has nothing to do with Hong Kong's freedom of the press at all 
It would have been the same problem if it had been a U.S. reporter or a British reporter 
-LSB- Patten -RSB- We are not seeking to interfere with somebody else's judicial system , not a bit of somebody else 's judicial system 
But there was genuine surprise in Hong Kong at a sentence handed out to somebody who worked for a Hong Kong newspaper for a story which apparently appeared on the front page of another Peking-supported newspaper in Hong Kong on the same day 
And there was great surprise at the severity of the sentence for disclosing economic information , exactly the sort of thing which helps the Hong Kong stock market to spin round day after day 
But what we have concentrated on is not any of that 
What we concentrated on is a simple issue : It is very important that journalists in Hong Kong know precisely the rules and regulations which Hong Kong journalists have to keep to if Hong Kong journalists are going to operate reasonably in China ; and what we do not want is the impression to be created that in order , perhaps , to get Hong Kong journalists to write things that Hong Kong journalists perhaps do not really feel or to censor Hong Kong journalists , exemplary sentences are going to be handed out , for reasons which people can not understand 
-LSB- Unidentified reporter -RSB- Today , many people in Hong Kong are requesting a special amnesty from the Chinese Government for Xi Yang 
Is such an amnesty possible 
-LSB- Lu -RSB- This is not within my authority 
As far as I know , there is no provision on special amnesty in China's Constitution 
No , there is none 
-LSB- Patten -RSB- I am surprised that senior Chinese officials do not understand why this case has caused so much concern in Hong Kong 
Not just a minority that have been worried about it , nor just a minority who have been worried about other things that have happened in China 
this case goes across the community 
-LSB- Lam -RSB- Governor , what is your government willing to do to safeguard press freedom ; for example , the freedom to information 
And the demand from legislators like Christine Loh , do you go for that 
-LSB- Patten -RSB- Well , what we are doing at the moment is looking at the suggestions in Christine Loh's bill 
We will be responding to that very soon and we are also committed to reviewing our existing legislation to remove from our existing legislation provisions which may be used by others to abuse press freedom 
-LSB- Reporter -RSB- Some Hong Kong reporters can not go to Qiandao Hu to cover the incident 
Is there any explanation 
-LSB- Lu -RSB- As to this issue , I personally feel that a simple issue does not seem necessary for Hong Kong reporters to boycott news gathering in China 
I do not see a simple issue as necessary 
What is the point 
necessary for Hong Kong reporters are two different things 
Why do you have to boycott news gathering in China 
-LSB- Reporter -RSB- China rejected necessary for Hong Kong reporters request to cover news in China 
Was China a retaliatory gesture 
-LSB- Lu -RSB- China is not an issue of retaliation 
It is common sense that since you have boycotted gathering news in China , why do you still want to come 
It is okay if you send other reporters in 
You boycotted , so let someone else take your place 
We still welcome other reporters to cover news 
-LSB- Reporter -RSB- In that case ... -LSB- Lu -RSB- You do not have to come yourself , do you 
-LSB- Reporter -RSB- Does that case ... -LSB- Lu -RSB- You do not have to come yourself mean that those who once said other reporters would boycott news gathering in China will be permanently barred from entering the mainland to cover news 
-LSB- Lu -RSB- No , no 
Does n't your boycott also have a timetable 
To the end of May , I heard 
I do not know 
I am not quite sure 
Is the end of May true that the boycott will continue to the end of May 
Is n't there a deadline , reporters 
-LSB- end recording -RSB- -LSB- Yuan -RSB- The biggest issue in dispute between China and Britain now is Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten's constitutional reform proposals 
Our reporter asked Lu Ping if the Legislative Council amends the proposals so that other reporters are in line with the Basic Law , will other reporters be acceptable 
-LSB- Begin recording -RSB- -LSB- Lu -RSB- This is absolutely impossible , because there is already an understanding between the two sides on how the first government should be formed , that is , the Chinese side and the British side should reach an agreement through diplomatic channels 
No agreement can be reached between China and Britain unless an agreement is through diplomatic channels 
This is not for the Legislative Council to decide 
It is not for the Legislative Council to lead the Chinese side and the British side by the nose 
To say the least , the Chinese side will not accept being led by the nose by the Hong Kong Legislative Council 
Therefore , the Chinese side will not acknowledge any decision adopted by the Legislative Council 
This is certain 
-LSB- Reporter -RSB- These days , we in Hong Kong are getting a clear message that the three-tier councils must be disbanded and reorganized in 1997 
But why is the Chinese side so firm on this issue and why is this attitude made known even before the Hong Kong Legislative Council passes any election proposal 
-LSB- Lu -RSB- We did not make known this attitude just now 
-LSB- Reporter -RSB- But now ... -LSB- Lu -RSB- After the British side shut the door tight on the arrangements for 1994-95 elections and refused carry on with the talks with us , we declared our attitude then 
This is not a new issue 
As you should know , in 1997 , the kind of change that will take place here is not like what happens when the British Conservative Party steps down and the Labor Party goes into power 
It will be a shift from one government to another 
Normally , under such circumstances , it stands to reason that a new government , new legislature , and new judicial body will be formed 
This is only normal 
We adopted the `` through train '' arrangement because the `` through train '' arrangement is a special measure 
Strictly speaking , everything should start anew and setting up a separate kitchen should apply to everything 
But for the sake of smooth transition , we adopted this special measure , namely , the `` through train '' option 
Yet this requires a basis , which is the British side's cooperation with us and convergence of the composition of the last Legislative Council with the provisions of the Basic Law 
-LSB- Patten -RSB- Well , there are some things which are in their sovereign power which I do not deny at all , though of course I would hope they would operate within the terms of their international treaty obligations as well : In this case , the Joint Declaration 
But they can do all sorts of things after 1997 if they want 
What they have to ask themselves is whether those things are in the interests of Hong Kong and whether those things will help to secure the hearts and minds of the people of Hong Kong 
-LSB- Reporter -RSB- Recently , a number of recommendations raised at the discussions of the PWC have caused much controversy among the people of Hong Kong 
The first recommendation is that civil servants should make The first recommendation clear whether or not its civil servants want to stay in its civil servants positions beyond 1997 
The more recent one is the extension of the operation of the land fund 
Do these two recommendations indicate that those at the PWC or the PWC members do not have a good idea of Hong Kong's reality or the agreements previously reached between China and Britain 
-LSB- Lu -RSB- No 
This is a sheer misunderstanding 
a sheer misunderstanding does not mean that the PWC members do not have a good idea of Hong Kong's conditions 
As far as I know , the PWC members did not put a sheer misunderstanding that way and the PWC did not discuss a sheer misunderstanding like that 
But how did the question come up 
Well , Cheng Yu-sho conducted a survey , a poll , did n't Cheng Yu-sho 
The results claimed that by 1997 , many civil servants , especially senior civil servants and administrative officers , will resign 
So we said if it is true that so many administrative officers will quit , there will be many things unattended to 
What should we do 
In fact , Cheng Yu-sho's survey was not comprehensive and Cheng Yu-sho results were impossible 
At that point , it was suggested that if a civil servant is not willing to go on to work in the Special Administrative Region -LSB- SAR -RSB- Government in 1997 , the KCR president should notify the Preparatory Committee or other authorities beforehand 
the KCR president should do the point the KCR president , making the point clear that the KCR president is not going to carry on beyond 1997 
This way , the chief executive or other chief officials can look for someone at an early stage to succeed the KCR president , so that the government's operation will not be affected or come to a stop 
This is how we put a pure misunderstanding and how we discussed a pure misunderstanding 
I do not know why stories came out in the newspapers later , claiming that the chief executive or other chief officials were asked to declare the chief executive or other chief officials so-called political stand 
I feel this is a pure misunderstanding 
We did not mean a pure misunderstanding at all 
If you ... -LSB- Lu pauses -RSB- I believe by 1997 , the overwhelming majority , 90 percent , of the civil servants will be happy to carry on in the Special Administrative Region Government 
Only a small proportion of especially senior civil servants may , when the time comes , wish to leave the government 
We hope these people will notify us two or three months in advance , as required by regulations 
As to the issue of the land fund , I feel this is also a pure misunderstanding 
At the subgroup discussion of the PWC , we made the subgroup discussion of the PWC very clear that the reason we discussed the issue of the land fund is that we hope on 1 July 1997 , without a day's delay , we can hand the land fund of over 100 billion -LSB- no currency specified as heard -RSB- , or something like that , to the SAR Government in one lump sum without retaining a cent 
But the question is which organization the land fund should go to 
We discussed whether the Foreign Exchange Fund should be the Foreign Exchange Fund or the Hong Kong Government's Financial Department 
No matter what , the land fund will certainly be handed to the Special Administrative Region Government 
If the Special Administrative Region Government , for a time , can not decide how to take care of this fund , the Special Administrative Region Government may temporarily retain the structure of the existing commission for managing the land fund 
This is why I said it was a pure misunderstanding 
-LSB- end recording -RSB- -LSB- Yuan -RSB- The Sino-British row has continued to this day without showing any signs of improvement 
When will Lu Ping come again 
Has Chris Patten considered the possibility of the British side extending a formal invitation to Lu Ping 
-LSB- Begin recording -RSB- -LSB- Patten -RSB- Well , that is something we will have to look at , whether or not it is sensible to make another formal suggestion to Director Lu 
I think the `` Lu knows perfectly well that as far as we are concerned , whenever the `` Lu would like a meeting , we would be very happy to have one 
-LSB- Lu -RSB- Now we do not have the basis 
First , you must go through these channels , including the channel of the PWC , and the two sides start communication and create some prospect of a solution through negotiation 
Then the two of us can have a talk on the basis of this and this is the only way we can possibly work out some solution 
If we go ahead and meet each other while nothing has settled into shape , it will be all empty 
The two of us can not possibly discuss many detailed issues 
Only when the detailed issues have been solved at the more preliminary levels can we expect some solution from our meeting 
-LSB- Patten -RSB- I very much hope that Director Lu will have had a very good week in Hong Kong , will have seen what progress we have made in the last couple of years since the last couple of years has been able to be here , will have seen that despite what was said at the recent PWC meeting , there is not much sign of social turmoil here in Hong Kong 
I hope Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten by Television Broadcasts Limited reporter Jenny Lam will have had an enjoyable stay and I hope an enjoyable stay will have encouraged Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten by Television Broadcasts Limited reporter Jenny Lam to come back many times before 30 June 1997 
We would very much like to see Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten by Television Broadcasts Limited reporter Jenny Lam and I hope that each time Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten by Television Broadcasts Limited reporter Jenny Lam comes , Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten by Television Broadcasts Limited reporter Jenny Lam will be able to broaden the number of people that Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten by Television Broadcasts Limited reporter Jenny Lam actually sees and communicates with
