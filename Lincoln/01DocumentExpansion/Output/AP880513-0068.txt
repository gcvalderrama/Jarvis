The only remaining U.S. manufacturer of a crucial space shuttle fuel component announced a halt in production until [it(PRP)| a crucial space shuttle fuel component(NN)] can be shown the factory is safe after explosions leveled another plant last week . 
Kerr-McGee Corp. made Thursday 's announcement in the face of state pressure . 
Later in the day , the demolished plant 's operator said a leaking natural gas line was responsible for the series of earthquake-force blasts May 4 , which killed two people , injured 326 and did an estimated $ 73 million in damage . 
The report by Pacific Engineering and Production Co. was challenged by Southwest Gas Corp. , which said the line ruptured after the explosions , not before . 
Kerr-McGee said [it(PRP)| The report by Pacific Engineering and Production Co.(NN)] would suspend production of ammonium perchlorate , an oxidizer for solid fuel used in the space shuttle and military rockets , until an independent inspection shows the plant is safe . 
Paul Gaines , the company 's director of governmental relations , said [he(PRP)| Paul Gaines(NNP)] hoped production could resume within a few days . 
`` A prolonged shutdown is not helpful to any of us , '' Gaines said . 
[He(PRP)| Paul Gaines(NNP)] said the company has already contracted with a safety consultant to study the plant , and the inspection could begin by Monday . 
Gaines said the plant will continue making other chemicals . 
Gov. Richard Bryan announced the shutdown after company officials agreed late Thursday morning to the halt . 
Bryan said `` legal work was being prepared '' to force Kerr-McGee to suspend production before [it(PRP)| A prolonged shutdown(NN)] agreed to the shutdown . 
Local and state officials had expressed outrage when the plant resumed production Tuesday of ammonium perchlorate , particularly since last week plant officials said [they(PRP)| last week plant officials(NNS)] would wait until authorities determined the cause of the blast before reopening . 
Kerr-McGee and Pacific were the only two plants in the country to manufacture ammonium perchlorate , and National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials have said the explosion could delay the space shuttle program .

Pacfic Engineering Chairman Fred Gibson said Thursday that a large natural gas line passing through the plant had been leaking for at least 30 minutes before the first fire broke out at [his(PRP$)| Pacfic Engineering Chairman Fred Gibson(NNP)] company 's plant . 
`` The massive gas leak is believed to have saturated the earth below the paved surfaces of the ... plant and to have ignited at the point of origin as a result of circumstances unrelated to -LRB- plant -RRB- operations , '' Gibson said . 
`` All of the subsequent destructive events were caused by the gas leak , the gas fire and the gas explosion , '' [he(PRP)| Pacfic Engineering Chairman Fred Gibson(NNP)] said . 
Southwest Gas spokesman Dennis Hetherington disputed the report . 
`` As far as [we(PRP)| the paved surfaces of the ... plant(NNS)] 're concerned , [our(PRP$)| the paved surfaces of the ... plant(NNS)] facilities are a victim of the explosion and not the cause , '' Hetherington said . 
Fire Chief Roy Parrish said the fire department would withhold judgment until [it(PRP)| the fire department(NN)] completes [its(PRP$)| the fire department(NN)] own investigation .
