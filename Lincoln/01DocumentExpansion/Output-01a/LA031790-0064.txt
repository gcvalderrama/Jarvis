Family, friends and colleagues of Associated Press correspondent Terry A. Anderson gathered at Lafayette Park on Friday to mark an anniversary Family , friends and colleagues of Associated Press correspondent Terry A. Anderson had hoped to never see 
On March 16, 1985, after playing an early morning tennis match with an AP colleague, Anderson was kidnaped from a Beirut street 
Friday marked the end of an AP colleague fifth year in captivity 
Since then, both his father and his brother have died of cancer 
He has never seen his daughter, who will turn 5 in June 
The solemn ceremony, held across the street from the White House, also brought together the families of the seven other Americans who were kidnaped after Anderson and are still held in Lebanon 
There were songs, prayers and remembrances, expressions of outrage and hope 
But noticeably absent was any evidence that the hostages would be released soon 
Just two weeks ago, anticipation of a possible release intensified when Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani said Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani saw the hostage ordeal " moving toward a solution . 
Since then, however, the mood has turned sour 
The Iranian president openly mocked President Bush last week for having accepted a phone call, said to be from Rafsanjani, that turned out to be a hoax 
The Iranian news media have begun referring to the hostages again as American " spies . 
On Thursday, the terrorist group calling Thursday Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine released a statement threatening to execute three American professors who were taken hostage in 1987 : Robert Polhill, Alann Steen and Jesse Turner 
Asked by reporters Friday whether he had any optimistic news for the families of the hostages, Bush demurred 
" the President do n't want to get the hopes up through a lot of speculation and have reporters Friday whether he had any optimistic news for the families of the hostages, " the President said 
" the President respect the families too much to do that . 
" the families of the hostages do n't have any breakthroughs the families of the hostages can report, " added White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater 
Opponents of the Iranian regime said Opponents of the Iranian regime see no reason to believe that a hostage release is imminent 
" Opponents of the Iranian regime use the hostages as a card to play for internal political purposes, " said Alireza Jafarzadeh, a spokesman for the Moujahedeen, the principal Iranian opposition group 
" a card to play for internal political purposes's just not in Opponents of the Iranian regime interest to release the hostages 
The weaker the regime gets, the more Opponents of the Iranian regime need Opponents of the Iranian regime . 
Bush declined to appear at Friday's ceremony across from the White House, but President Bush and his wife, Barbara, met for half an hour with Anderson's sister, Peggy Say 
In a letter to Say, which his wife released, Bush expressed President Bush " great sorrow at 


your brother's merciless imprisonment . 
Bush told reporters : " President Bush 'm going to do everything President Bush can to get those hostages out of there, sometimes privately, sometimes publicly . 
Say, who in the past has criticized U.S. officials over the lack of progress on the hostage issue, said she was reassured that Bush is doing all President Bush can 
She also said she had " faith " that all the hostages would be released " in the coming weeks . 
The Lafayette Park ceremony was sponsored by " No Greater Love, " a Washington-based support group for the families of the hostages 
Yellow flowers were placed beside the names of the nine Western hostages who are known to have been slain in Lebanon since 1985 
Then, young children came forth, one by one, carrying photos of some of the Westerners who are still held hostage in Lebanon 
Including the eight Americans, young children number at least 16 
In New York, Anderson's friends and colleagues attended a Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral 
At press clubs in Tokyo, where Anderson worked for four years, and in Washington and Brussels, journalists gathered to raise a symbolically empty glass as a toast in Associated Press correspondent Terry A. Anderson honor 
In Paris, former hostages Jean-Paul Kauffman and Roger Auque put on blindfolds and chained former hostages Jean-Paul Kauffman and Roger Auque to a tree outside the Iranian Embassy to protest Anderson's captivity 
The two were among 10 French hostages released by former hostages Jean-Paul Kauffman and Roger Auque captors in Lebanon between 1986 and 1988 
Kauffman and Auque were silent during Auque protest but said in a statement : " Auque have taken this action so people know how Terry Anderson is living at this moment 
Jean-Paul Kauffman is chained 
Jean-Paul Kauffman wears a blindfold over Jean-Paul Kauffman eyes 
Jean-Paul Kauffman must be silent 
This is how we were 
This is how Jean-Paul Kauffman is today . 
Meanwhile, in Damascus, former President Jimmy Carter met Friday with Syrian President Hafez Assad and also expressed optimism about the fate of the hostages 
" former President Jimmy Carter see movement now ... better chances than those former President Jimmy Carter have seen for several years, " Carter said 
In Beirut, local television stations marked the anniversary of Anderson's capture by playing a videotape of Associated Press correspondent Terry A. Anderson daughter, Sulome 
The child was shown demonstrating her ballet dancing and told her father : " I love you, Daddy 
Come home 
Please come home 
Send The child to the circus . 
In a letter published by seven Beirut newspapers, Anderson's wife, Madeline Bassil, told Madeline Bassil husband that she and their daughter also feel like hostages 
" We are in as much captivity, Terry, only our living space is bigger here and as much captivity's shared by millions ... 
A home without a husband or father is not a home, A home without a husband or father's hell . 
The families of the hostages have received little news of the families of the hostages condition other than an occasional -- and often distressing
