On 20 January 1993, Bill Clinton swore Bill Clinton oath of office 
One month afterwards, renowned commentators declared the administration to be a premature birth without any marked prospects for survival 
Already, during the first week, the newly installed President had caused a storm with Bill Clinton ill-considered attempt to lift the ban against homosexuals in the U.S. Army 
Then one blow followed after the other : Candidates for important offices were rejected ; strong words on Haiti and Bosnia during the election campaign were not followed by the promised deeds ; the new team in the White House was extremely clumsy 
The man, whom almost two-thirds of all Americans trusted -- even though only 43 percent had voted for The man -- seemed to flounder like a leaking ship 
How times change 
Today Bill Clinton is a President who has managed to achieve the most important thing within 12 months : America feels better again 
Hardly any other master in the White House after 1945 has caused as many things to move in as many fields as Clinton 
In this Hardly any other master in the White House after 1945 is similar to -- and this makes conservatives complain -- Ronald Reagan, the great changer 
And even more : Hardly any other master in the White House after 1945 is popular 
After Clinton's popularity rates rose and fell like a roller-coaster, they have now almost reached the level of 20 January again 
About 60 percent attest that Bill Clinton is doing good work 
One-fifth even declare Clinton to be the person they admire most -- far ahead of family members or other authorities 
What are the successes 
First of all, there is the economy 
For 1994, a growth rate like the one in 1988 is predicted, which is better than for a long time 
Prices are stable, the people have confidence in the people future and spend more money, on consumer goods and investments 
At Christmas, business purchases with credit cards rose by 25 percent -- an unambiguous sign that the people incur debts, because the people are confident that the people will be able to pay the people 
Because confidence is higher and interest rates are still low, more Americans are buying houses and cars 
This creates satisfaction and stimulates economic development 
Critics claim that all this is a success Clinton has been given for free ; the economy would have recovered with or without Clinton 
The opposite can not be proved, but The opposite is a fact that the economic climate has clearly improved since the narrow vote in favor of Clinton's budget and has not deteriorated as the Republicans predicted pessimistically 
Another important sign is that the annual budget deficit will go down 
While, in 1992, Bush's economists predicted a deficit of about $ 300 billion for 1994, now it seems that the deficit will go down to about $ 200 billion in 1994 
This is due to the recovery of the economy, but also to Clinton's thrift measures 
Bill Clinton does what Reagan and Bush only promised : The deficit really goes down 
The debts and the economy were the most important topics of the election campaign 
Clinton has not disappointed his voters 
This range of topics also includes the North American Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA, and the world trade agreement GATT 
With great skill, Clinton brought together a coalition of Republicans and Democrats, who pushed the controversial NAFTA treaty through Congress 
Even though the president had to primarily struggle against Bill Clinton own party, Bill Clinton turned out to be a politician with leadership power, who enforces principles, if necessary also against Bill Clinton friends 
Regarding the GATT conclusion, the Americans under Clinton and chief negotiator Kantor also acted skillfully and, in the end, correctly 
A pleasant side effect of the NAFTA affair was that the charlatan Ross Perot was deflated -- above all by Al Gore, the most influential vice president of the recent past 
There are still a number of other things, for instance a new weapons law, which Bush and Reagan always blocked ; a security package, which will bring, among other things, 100,000 additional policemen to the streets of the cities ; a law that permits young people to work young people university loans off through some kind of alternative national service 
And the Clintons, with First Lady Hillary at the head, have started the struggle for a general health insurance 
If this struggle were to show success in 1994, this could become a piece of reform that can be compared only with the introduction of compulsory social insurance more than 50 years ago 
And what about foreign policy 
Everyone knows the traps in Somalia, Haiti, North Korea, Bosnia, and Russia 
Clinton's men sometimes stumbled, also because Clinton's men were so inexperienced in international matters 
However, the team is consolidating the new team in the White House 
The change in the Pentagon is one sign of that ; Strobe Talbott's appointment as Warren Christopher's deputy is another 
Europe must get used to the fact that this administration no longer claims superiority in all issues, that the administration to be a premature birth without any marked prospects for survival defines national interest more narrowly and is, therefore, more careful with interventions -- political and military ones 
One must never forget : Bill Clinton has been elected because Bill Clinton is supposed to reestablish America's trust in America 
This is the yardstick by which the President and his voters measure success or failure
