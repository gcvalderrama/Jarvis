In the summer of 1990 , Jay Fields and his wife were expecting [their(PRP$)| Jay Fields and his wife(NNP)] second child . 
Mr. Fields , who worked at First Boston Corp. , asked his boss , a woman , for the same three months of paid child-care leave that [she(PRP)| a woman(NN)] [herself(PRP)| a woman(NN)] had received a few months earlier . 
[She(PRP)| a woman(NN)] said no . 
He appealed to [her(PRP$)| a woman(NN)] boss . 
He said no . 
Mr. Fields pointed out that it was probably illegal to deny an expectant father benefits that expectant mothers got . 
`` [They(PRP)| expectant mothers(NNS)] said there was nothing [they(PRP)| expectant mothers(NNS)] could do about it , '' recalls Mr. Fields , who later quit for a job elsewhere . 
`` It was an unwritten rule that leave was at a manager 's discretion and [it(PRP)| an unwritten rule that leave was at a manager 's discretion(NN)] did n't apply to men . '' 
As the problem of child care for working parents continues to fester , employers ' selective flexibility is creating a new caste system . 
Favored employees are able to cut deals their colleagues ca n't , breeding uniquely sharp , and mostly hidden , resentments . 
Mr. Fields 's experience was typical in that [it(PRP)| Mr. Fields 's experience(NN)] began in uncertainty and ended in bitterness ; [it(PRP)| Mr. Fields 's experience(NN)] was unusual only in that [he(PRP)| a manager 's(NN)] spoke up about [it(PRP)| Mr. Fields 's experience(NN)] . 
The covert conflict pits men against women , mothers against other mothers , professional women against nonprofessionals and children 's needs against those of employers . 
`` [It(PRP)| a new kind of class structure(NN)] 's a new kind of class structure , '' says Arlene Johnson , program director for work-force research at the Conference Board , a business research group in New York . 
`` Instead of ` What side of the tracks did you grow up on ? ' 
[it(PRP)| Instead of ` What side of the tracks(NN)] 'll be ` Did your family work for a family-supportive company ? ' '' 
The family-leave bill mandating unpaid leave for most workers would begin to even things out . 
But President Bush has threatened to veto the bill if the House , as expected , passes [it(PRP)| House(NNP)] in the next few weeks . 
Businesses , lobbying heavily against [it(PRP)| The family-leave bill mandating unpaid leave for most workers(NN)] , argue that the bill infringes on [their(PRP$)| most workers(NNS)] flexibility to plan for [their(PRP$)| most workers(NNS)] own labor needs . 
But corporate attorneys warn that just as employers often failed to establish policies protecting [themselves(PRP)| employers '(NNS)] against sexual harassment charges , [they(PRP)| employers '(NNS)] now are failing to recognize the legal pitfalls of giving benefits to the few . 
`` The whole atmosphere is ripe for claims against companies that have flexible arrangements '' for only some employees , says Joseph DeGiuseppe Jr. , a lawyer at Skadden , Arps , Slate , Meagher & Flom in New York . 
`` You ca n't say female employees with children can work on a flexible arrangement , but if you 're Jewish and want to leave early on Friday you ca n't do it . '' 
Last year a federal appeals court in Pittsburgh ruled that the board of education there illegally discriminated against a male teacher in 1981 by refusing [him(PRP)| a male teacher in 1981(NN)] a one-year parental leave offered to women . 
The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission cited the case in December when it issued new policy guidelines stating that employers offering leave to mothers must offer the same leave to fathers . 
`` This issue is just coming to the forefront now , '' says a spokeswoman for the commission . 
For now , employees who lose out in the corporate child-care sweepstakes are seething rather than suing . 
Mr. Fields , who worked in First Boston 's information systems division , says [he(PRP)| a spokeswoman for the commission(NN)] considered legal action but decided it was n't worth jeopardizing [his(PRP$)| a spokeswoman for the commission(NN)] job . 
First Boston says [it(PRP)| First Boston Corp.(NNP)] does n't have a paternity policy ; fathers can ask for an unpaid personal leave , but that has to be negotiated with the employee 's manager . 
While not all mothers get paid , three-month leaves , the firm says , a woman would get such a leave under the firm 's disability policy if a doctor 's opinion required [it(PRP)| a doctor 's opinion(NN)] . 
When Laurel Stemper , a 40-year-old insurance broker in Atlanta , took a 12-week pregnancy leave from Garlington Group Inc. in 1989 , [she(PRP)| Laurel Stemper(NNP)] assumed [her(PRP)| Laurel Stemper(NNP)] job was secure because another woman had taken such a leave . 
Two weeks after [her(PRP$)| Laurel Stemper(NNP)] return , [her(PRP$)| Laurel Stemper(NNP)] boss said the company was eliminating her position . 
[Her(PRP$)| Laurel Stemper(NNP)] responsibilities went to a woman past childbearing age who had filled in for [her(PRP)| Laurel Stemper(NNP)] . 
[She(PRP)| Laurel Stemper(NNP)] complained to the EEOC , but decided not to file a claim . 
`` [I(PRP)| Laurel Stemper(NNP)] did n't want to be blackballed in the industry , '' [she(PRP)| Laurel Stemper(NNP)] says . 
`` [I(PRP)| Laurel Stemper(NNP)] needed to find another job . '' 
Garlington declines to comment . 
`` A lot of females are afraid , '' says a human-resources vice president at a regional bank who asks that [her(PRP$)| Garlington(NNP)] name and [her(PRP$)| Garlington(NNP)] employer 's not be given . 
`` [They(PRP)| females(NNS)] have worked so hard to get to a point that [they(PRP)| females(NNS)] do n't want to jeopardize [it(PRP)| a point(NN)] . '' 
This woman 's colleague adds , `` [We(PRP)| females(NNS)] have a woman CEO , but [she(PRP)| a woman(NN)] avoids the issue because [she(PRP)| a woman(NN)] 's one of the few women in an all-male world . '' 
Some women are so nervous that [they(PRP)| Some women(NNS)] try to appear biologically correct at all times . 
One analyst at a New York securities firm says [she(PRP)| a woman(NN)] timed things so [she(PRP)| a woman(NN)] would n't appear pregnant during performance reviews in October and would n't give birth until after bonus time in January . 
A woman in a job-sharing program at Steelcase Inc. says [she(PRP)| A woman in a job-sharing program at Steelcase Inc.(NN)] keeps pictures of her children off [her(PRP$)| A woman in a job-sharing program at Steelcase Inc.(NN)] desk . 
Many companies say [their(PRP$)| Many companies(NNS)] case-by-case approach to child care is the fairest , most efficient way to handle dual-career parents . 
Poor performers and easily replaceable employees , [they(PRP)| Poor performers(NNS)] say , should n't get special child-care arrangements . 
`` [It(PRP)| the fairest , most efficient way to handle dual-career parents(NN)] has to be to the benefit of shareholders , or [you(PRP)| This woman 's colleague(NN)] are n't going to do [it(PRP)| the fairest , most efficient way to handle dual-career parents(NN)] , '' says William B. Harrison , 48 , a Chemical Bank vice chairman who has approved innovative job-sharing arrangements for some high-ranking women executives . 
With no formal policy , Chemical approves flexible work schedules on a case-by-case basis . 
To the extent that children of more adept employees benefit , says Royall Victor III , 52 , a managing director , `` then [I(PRP)| children of more adept employees benefit(NNS)] would say those children are particularly lucky to be the children of creative , ambitious parents . 
[We(PRP)| more adept employees(NNS)] do n't all come out of a cookie cutter . '' 
Winning benefits -- particularly the coveted perk of flexible hours -- has become a delicate , stealthy art , played best by working parents in positions of power . 
Private deals that do n't remain so can easily be blown apart by co-workers resentful of special treatment . 
When Kim Samara , 36 , took maternity leave from Hewlett-Packard Co. in 1986 , [she(PRP)| Kim Samara(NNP)] thought [she(PRP)| Kim Samara(NNP)] had an agreement to return , working two days a week in the office and one at home . 
When [she(PRP)| Kim Samara(NNP)] came back , [she(PRP)| Kim Samara(NNP)] was working for a younger woman new in [her(PRP$)| Kim Samara(NNP)] job in a group with two other , still-younger women . 
After six months , her co-workers complained about the arrangement . 
Ellen Eisner , 34 , one former co-worker , says that if Ms. Samara was caring for [her(PRP$)| Kim Samara(NNP)] baby at home , why was [she being paid to work(PRP)| Kim Samara(NNP)] ? 
And if [she(PRP)| Ellen Eisner(NNP)] was working , why was n't [she(PRP)| Ellen Eisner(NNP)] in the office ? 
`` [You(PRP)| children of more adept employees benefit(NNS)] 're either working eight hours a day or [you(PRP)| children of more adept employees benefit(NNS)] 're taking care of children , '' says Ms. Eisner , who is unmarried . 
`` [I(PRP)| Ellen Eisner(NNP)] would love to work one day at home . 
[It(PRP)| one day at home(NN)] was n't an option open to [me(PRP)| Ellen Eisner(NNP)] . '' 
After months of talks , Ms. Samara was told [she(PRP)| Kim Samara(NNP)] had to work full time . 
[She(PRP)| Kim Samara(NNP)] quit , feeling bitter toward the company and [her(PRP$)| Kim Samara(NNP)] colleagues . 
But she and Ms. Eisner both think much of the fault rests with Hewlett-Packard ; because it did n't have a standard policy , Ms. Samara says , `` [you(PRP)| Ellen Eisner(NNP)] were totally at the mercy of [your(PRP$)| Ellen Eisner(NNP)] manager . 
If [your(PRP$)| Ellen Eisner(NNP)] manager felt secure and would stick their neck out for [you(PRP)| Ellen Eisner(NNP)] , [you(PRP)| Ellen Eisner(NNP)] were okay . '' 
Julie Kertzman , Ms. Samara 's former supervisor , says [she(PRP)| Julie Kertzman(NNP)] asked Ms. Samara to come back full time not because of resentment among other subordinates but because the position , product management , demanded [it(PRP)| the position , product management(NN)] . 
`` There are some situations where -LCB- part time -RCB- is feasible and some where , based on the business need , [it(PRP)| the business need(NN)] is n't , '' [she(PRP)| Julie Kertzman(NNP)] says . 
`` And you have to be really honest about that . '' 
Just as top managers get more stock options and nicer offices , [they(PRP)| top managers(NNS)] get better child-care deals than the working class . 
One company supplying child care even has a division -- called ExecuTots -- catering to professionals . 
`` You are talking about two different worlds , '' says Claire Lifshitz , the office manager for a local of the Oil , Chemical & Atomic Workers International Union . 
`` In factory work , once you punch your time card , your children do n't exist . 
If you have a sick child , you do n't go in , and you do n't get paid for that day . 
If that happens too often , you are out of work . '' 
Merck & Co. provided seed money for a day-care center more than 10 years ago after a woman scientist threatened to resign , but tuition at the center , in Rahway , N.J. , is about $ 680 a month . 
Professionals can afford that ; secretaries ca n't . 
Only now , as Merck plans the construction of two new child-care centers , is the company considering subsidies for its lower-paid employees . 
`` [We(PRP)| its lower-paid employees(NNS)] do feel [we(PRP)| its lower-paid employees(NNS)] would like to have the centers accessible to employees at all levels and not really be favoring only the professionals , '' says Richard Parker , director of human resource administrative services at Merck . 
`` [We(PRP)| its lower-paid employees(NNS)] would rather not say [we(PRP)| its lower-paid employees(NNS)] have one class of employee that is more valuable to [us(PRP)| its lower-paid employees(NNS)] than another . '' 
Even companies with formal child-care policies find that managers are n't always keen on implementing [them(PRP)| top managers(NNS)] . 
NCNB Corp. says [its(PRP$)| NCNB Corp.(NNP)] supervisors fall into three categories : those who aggressively promote work-family benefits , those who make deals for a few subordinates , and those who ignore the whole issue . 
`` There can be resentment when employees hear a corporate message that 's different from the reality , '' says Karen Geiger , the bank 's career development director . 
`` Typically , someone will call [me(PRP)| Karen Geiger , the bank 's career development director(NNP)] anonymously and say , ` [I(PRP)| Karen Geiger , the bank 's career development director(NNP)] am getting the impression that this is n't okay here . ' 
Then [I(PRP)| Karen Geiger , the bank 's career development director(NNP)] will talk to that manager and see if [I(PRP)| Karen Geiger , the bank 's career development director(NNP)] can work something out . '' 
NCNB is unusual in having [its(PRP$)| NCNB Corp.(NNP)] human-resources department act as an ombudsman in such cases . 
More typically , even discussing child-care issues at work is freighted with potential for embarrassment , censure and career-limiting exposure . 
A woman who declined to be interviewed for this article was so nervous about the topic that [she(PRP)| A woman who declined to be interviewed for this article(NN)] later wrote this cordial note : `` As [you(PRP)| Karen Geiger , the bank 's career development director(NNP)] know , upon consideration of [your(PRP$)| Karen Geiger , the bank 's career development director(NNP)] request , [I(PRP)| A woman who declined to be interviewed for this article(NN)] have decided not to discuss [my(PRP$)| A woman who declined to be interviewed for this article(NN)] personal experience or [my(PRP$)| A woman who declined to be interviewed for this article(NN)] views on the subject . 
Naturally , this also means that [I(PRP)| A woman who declined to be interviewed for this article(NN)] do not want any reference made to [myself(PRP)| A woman who declined to be interviewed for this article(NN)] or the company for which [I(PRP)| A woman who declined to be interviewed for this article(NN)] work , including the fact that [I(PRP)| A woman who declined to be interviewed for this article(NN)] have declined to participate in [your(PRP$)| Karen Geiger , the bank 's career development director(NNP)] research ...
