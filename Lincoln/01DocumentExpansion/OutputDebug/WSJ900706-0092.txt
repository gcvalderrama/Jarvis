In searching for someone to care for her three children , Bonnie Fay of Alexandria , Va. , turned to Mother 's Helper Agency , which billed itself in national advertising as `` serving America 's most prestigious families . '' 
But the nanny sent by the agency turned out to be something less than Mary Poppins . 
Ms. Fay says [she(PRP)| Bonnie Fay of Alexandria , Va.(NNP)] found marijuana in the room of the woman [she(PRP)| Bonnie Fay of Alexandria , Va.(NNP)] hired three years ago as a live-in nanny . 
And [she(PRP)| Bonnie Fay of Alexandria , Va.(NNP)] fired the woman after [she(PRP)| Bonnie Fay of Alexandria , Va.(NNP)] admitted stealing money from Ms. Fay to silence a boyfriend who threatened to tell the nanny 's parents about a past abortion . 
Mother 's Helper then demanded an additional $ 100 to find a replacement nanny , Ms. Fay says . 
The agency says [it(PRP)| Helper Agency(NNP)] does n't know whether Ms. Fay 's allegations are true , and [it(PRP)| Helper Agency(NNP)] asked for the extra fee because the 60-day replacement period was past . 
Ms. Fay sued the agency and won a judgment of $ 1,323 for costs incurred , including fees paid to the agency . 
[Her(PRP$)| Bonnie Fay of Alexandria , Va.(NNP)] advice to other working parents : consumer beware . 
In a nation of ever more two-paycheck couples , nannies have become a hot commodity . 
Agencies have sprung up to supply [them(PRP)| ever more two-paycheck couples(NNS)] for fees of $ 400 to $ 2,500 . 
Many of the agencies do a conscientious job . 
But some dissatisfied customers tell of unchecked references , deficient screening , broken contracts and unrefunded fees . 
James Rock and Sue Nelson turned to Helping Hands of Potomac , Md. , for a nanny last year , and the one the agency sent seemed ideal . 
[She(PRP)| Ms. Nelson(NNP)] had worked for the family of former Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci , among others . 
Ms. Nelson says [she(PRP)| Ms. Nelson(NNP)] and [her(PRP$)| Ms. Nelson(NNP)] husband were further impressed when the agency told [them(PRP)| others(NNS)] that `` friends of the Carluccis wanted to hire [her(PRP)| the family of former Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci(NN)] . '' 
So the couple hired the nanny for $ 265 a week , plus health benefits , [her(PRP$)| the couple(NN)] own two-bedroom basement apartment and use of a car . 
Mr. Rock , a tax lobbyist , and Ms. Nelson , a staffer on the Senate Budget Committee , say that about two months later [they(PRP)| Ms. Nelson and Mr. Rock(NNP)] were horrified to find purple bruises across their two-year-old son 's buttocks while bathing [him(PRP)| their two-year-old son 's(NN)] one night . 
At an emergency room , a physician concluded the boy had `` been hit repeatedly with a long flat stick , '' recalls Ms. Nelson . 
The nanny denied harming the child , but left the next morning . 
As [they(PRP)| Ms. Nelson and Mr. Rock(NNP)] later learned , Mr. Carlucci 's wife , Marcia , says Helping Hands never called [her(PRP$)| Marcia(NNP)] about the nanny . 
[Her(PRP$)| Marcia(NNP)] reference would n't have been glowing . 
`` [She(PRP)| Marcia(NNP)] was , among other things , very , very lazy , '' says Mrs. Carlucci , who also recalls that the nanny had had two accidents with the family 's car . 
Stephanie Hecht , president of Jasah Inc. , which does business as Helping Hands , insists [she(PRP)| Stephanie Hecht(NNP)] had checked the nanny 's references . 
But [she(PRP)| Stephanie Hecht(NNP)] says [she(PRP)| Stephanie Hecht(NNP)] ca n't remember whether [she(PRP)| Stephanie Hecht(NNP)] spoke to the Carluccis . 
Ms. Nelson and Mr. Rock never accused the nanny of beating the child ; the couple said [they(PRP)| Ms. Nelson and Mr. Rock(NNP)] had no proof . 
But [they(PRP)| Ms. Nelson and Mr. Rock(NNP)] charged the agency with inadequate screening and demanded a refund . 
When [they(PRP)| Ms. Nelson and Mr. Rock(NNP)] could n't get [their(PRP$)| Ms. Nelson and Mr. Rock(NNP)] money back , Ms. Nelson and Mr. Rock took [their(PRP$)| Ms. Nelson and Mr. Rock(NNP)] dispute to court . 
[They(PRP)| Ms. Nelson and Mr. Rock(NNP)] won a default judgment earlier this year after the agency failed to contest the claim . 
[They(PRP)| Ms. Nelson and Mr. Rock(NNP)] recently got a check for $ 500 from Helping Hands . 
Nationally , there are some 500 placement agencies for nannies . 
Washington , D.C. , home to the highest percentage of working women among major cities , has a high concentration of such agencies . 
Many nannies referred by them are young women with child-care experience but little formal training , recruited from towns in the West or Midwest . 
Weekly salaries range from about $ 150 to $ 450 or more in costly areas such as New York , plus room and board . 
Some even get health insurance , paid vacations and holidays , and the use of a car . 
For a look at the kinds of complaints that can arise , consider those lodged against Capable Care Agency , which until last year was called Mother 's Helper Agency . 
Over the past three years , more than a dozen complaints have been filed with the Washington Office of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs , the small-claims branch of the District of Columbia Superior Court , and the local Better Business Bureau . 
The complaints typically involve screening problems or disputes over refunds or replacements . 
Most of the complaints have been resolved . 
Marla Sanders , a co-owner of Capable Care , based in Washington , with a branch in Philadelphia , says the agency may appear to have more problems than others because [it(PRP)| Helper Agency(NNP)] does a greater volume of business . 
-LRB- Ms. Sanders also owns a nanny-placement agency in Beverly Hills , Calif. , which retains the name Mother 's Helper . -RRB- 
Ms. Sanders calculates that the Washington agency has placed 2,400 nannies since 1985 . 
`` [It(PRP)| a very good agency(NN)] 's a very good agency , '' [she(PRP)| Marla Sanders(NNP)] says . 
`` [I(PRP)| Marla Sanders(NNP)] certainly do n't invite these things to happen , and [I(PRP)| Marla Sanders(NNP)] feel very bad when [they(PRP)| 2,400 nannies since 1985(NNS)] happen . '' 
Ms. Sanders , a single mother , says [she(PRP)| Marla Sanders(NNP)] started the business , which now has nine full-time employees , after a bad experience with an agency [herself(PRP)| Marla Sanders(NNP)] . 
Capable Care bills [itself(PRP)| the business(NN)] as `` nationally known for quality child care '' and entreats parents to `` maximize your child 's prime learning years with important help in language and social development . '' 
[It(PRP)| Capable Care Agency(NNP)] 's a pitch that attracts many . 
John and Sally Wilhelm chose Capable Care over other agencies when searching for someone to care for [their(PRP$)| John and Sally Wilhelm(NNP)] two-year-old son last year . 
From three referrals , the couple chose a young woman from Utah who noted on [her(PRP$)| the couple(NN)] application that [she(PRP)| the couple(NN)] preferred to work with children aged two and older . 
The agency described [her(PRP)| the couple(NN)] as `` quiet , calm and well-balanced , '' the Wilhelms say . 
[They(PRP)| children aged two(NNS)] paid the agency $ 1,000 in registration and placement fees , and advanced the woman 's $ 224 air fare . 
But [she(PRP)| the woman(NN)] seemed unhappy from the moment [she(PRP)| the woman(NN)] arrived , the Wilhelms say . 
[She(PRP)| the woman(NN)] did n't seem comfortable handling a toddler . 
[She(PRP)| the woman(NN)] would sit anxiously at the bottom of the stairs , for instance , while [her(PRP$)| the woman(NN)] charge napped in a second-floor bedroom . 
[She(PRP)| the woman(NN)] suffered a bout of intense crying several days after arriving and finally quit , saying [she(PRP)| the woman(NN)] did n't like working with toddlers , the Wilhelms say . 
Mr. Wilhelm , who is a writer and television producer , says a Capable Care official later acknowledged that the nanny 's application had n't been updated for several years . 
The agency refunded the couple 's fee after several months of complaints . 
Ms. Sanders says that though the application had n't been updated as [it(PRP)| the nanny 's application(NN)] should have been , the agency checked with the nanny 's most recent employer , whom [she(PRP)| the nanny 's most recent employer(NN)] had left only three months earlier . 
Ms. Sanders says the family gave [her a(PRP)| the family of former Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci(NN)] `` very good reference . '' 
The nanny `` just was n't comfortable '' with the Wilhelms , Ms. Sanders says . 
[She(PRP)| a live-in nanny(NN)] says the agency refunded the fee after offering replacements . 
Ms. Sanders and other agency owners say that matching nannies to families is a delicate process . 
Sometimes , personalities just do n't mesh . 
Often , too , nannies who come from small towns get homesick and have adjustment problems in big cities . 
Capable Care says [it(PRP)| a delicate process(NN)] screens carefully . 
[It(PRP)| a delicate process(NN)] asks for three child-care references and one character reference , interviews the nanny 's own family and reviews [her(PRP$)| the nanny 's own family(NN)] work history , says Ms. Sanders . 
Criminal and driver 's records are checked in the nanny 's state of current residence , though the agency usually must rely on the nanny [herself(PRP)| a live-in nanny(NN)] to supply any criminal records . 
The agency also asks applicants to fill out medical and psychological questionnaires . 
Most applicants are interviewed only by telephone before being referred to families . 
If , after 20 days , a nanny does n't work out , the agency says [it(PRP)| 20 days(NNS)] offers to refund half the referral fee . 
The agency says [it(PRP)| Helper Agency(NNP)] offers to refer names of a replacement if problems develop in the nanny 's first 60 days , or up to six months if the family pays a higher fee . 
Ms. Sanders says [her(PRP$)| Marla Sanders(NNP)] repeat business and customer referrals speak of customer satisfaction . 
`` They have always been very cooperative with [me(PRP)| Christine Mroczek , a Falls Church , Va. , health administrator , who says she employed three nannies through the agency ; she praised both the agency 's screening capabilities and the nannies she hired(NNP)] , '' says Christine Mroczek , a Falls Church , Va. , health administrator , who says she employed three nannies through the agency ; she praised both the agency 's screening capabilities and the nannies she hired . 
Jeanne Tannebaum , a Washington critical-care nurse , says the agency honored [her(PRP$)| Jeanne Tannebaum(NNP)] replacement guarantee even after [she(PRP)| Jeanne Tannebaum(NNP)] exceeded the time limits . 
Inadequate screening can have tragic results . 
The National Academy of Nannies Inc. , a Denver training school , settled out of court last year a lawsuit involving the referral of a live-in nanny who gave a prescription anti-depressant drug , apparently to stop an eight-month-old from crying ; the boy nearly died . 
After the 1985 incident , Denise Reich , the boy 's mother , learned the nanny had a lengthy medical file detailing a history of violence , mental disorders and drug abuse . 
Mrs. Reich and Terri Eurich , president of the Academy , wo n't comment on the case . 
The International Nanny Association , a national advocacy group for nannies , agencies and child-care educators , is pushing for national standards and training credentials for care-givers . 
At a recent convention the group 's board passed standards that member agencies must meet , including requiring [them(PRP)| nannies , agencies and child-care educators(NNS)] to check nannies ' references . 
Nanny training programs that are members of the group also must meet standards requiring certain levels of competency from [their(PRP$)| members of the group(NNS)] graduates . 
A good agency undertakes a comprehensive screening program that goes further than checking references , looking into criminal and driving records and requiring applicants to complete a medical history questionnaire , says Bonnie Roeder , an agency owner who heads the ethics committee for the nanny association . 
In their defense , agencies say families themselves sometimes mistreat nannies . 
They point to cases where parents try to slip out of contracts , do n't bother checking references on their own , or overload nannies with work . 
But Ms. Roeder also concedes that `` there are some real pockets in this industry that [I(PRP)| Bonnie Roeder(NNP)] would like to see we get rid of because [it(PRP)| Defense(NNP)] affects the rest of us who are trying to do a good job . ''
