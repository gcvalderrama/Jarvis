A new drug called 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, or 2-CdA, has produced
complete remissions in almost all hairy cell leukemia patients
treated.  It may well be the drug of choice in treating hairy cell
leukemia.  It has also been used successfully against chronic
lymphocytic leukemia.  Doctors gave the drug four years ago to 12
hairy cell leukemia patients.  In 11 the disease disappeared and has
not reappeared.  In all, 24 patients have been treated with the drug
with almost complete success.  However, doctors at the Scripps Clinic
and Research Foundation caution that longer follow up will be
necessary before they can be sure of an actual cure.
