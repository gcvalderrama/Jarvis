Neil Mallon Bush, third son of the President, has become the poster
boy of the S&L scandal because of his involvement with the failed
Silverado S&L. Born January 22, 1955, Bush moved to Denver in 1980 and
negotiated oil leases for Amoco. He and two partners then started an
exploration company, into which developers Kenneth Good and Bill
Walters invested money despite lack of results. Because of his name,
Bush was invited onto the rubber-stamp board of Silverado, whose
manipulative management team made huge loans for risky real estate
schemes with FDIC insured deposits. Good and Walters defaulted on $117
million in Silverado loans.
