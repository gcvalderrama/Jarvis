Distortions of Judge Bork's unambiguous civil-rights record are a lie.
As an Appellate Judge for the District of Columbia, never did he
render an opinion less sympathetic to minority or women's rights than
the Supreme Court.  Furthermore, his opinions are among the circuit's
most notable rulings.  As Solicitor General Bork argued more pro-
civil rights cases than any Supreme Court nominee since Thurgood
Marshall.  The NAACP Legal Defense Fund supported him in 9 of the 10
cases where they both filed briefs.  Yet, Senator Biden claims,
"Throughout his career, Judge Bork has opposed virtually every civil
rights advance."  How can this be?
