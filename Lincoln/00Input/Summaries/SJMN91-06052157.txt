More than 3,000 passengers and crewmembers were evacuated early
Wednesday from the Sovereign of the Seas cruise ship after a fire
broke out in a pantry.  One crewman suffered from smoke inhalation,
but there were no other injuries in the fire.  The ship was moored in
San Juan when the fire was discovered.

The 14-deck, 800-foot luxury liner will return to Miami where it will
be met by a two- member team from the National Transportation and
Safety Board to investigate the fire.

The board has been concerned about safety in the cruise ship industry
because of the potential for a major disaster.
