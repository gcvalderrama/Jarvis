Following the success of the Gulf War, talk is beginning of electoral
careers for the victorious Pentagon leaders; namely, Colin Powell, the
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  He has attributes valued by
both Democrats and Republicans.  His positions on foreign policy and
aggressive use of the US forces abroad put him in the mainstream of
the GOP, but the Democratic Party is attuned to values from his
personal life.  Powell was born in Harlem of Jamaican immigrant
parents who struggled to earn a living, was raised in South Bronx, and
took advantage of opportunities for blacks in City College of New
York's ROTC program.
