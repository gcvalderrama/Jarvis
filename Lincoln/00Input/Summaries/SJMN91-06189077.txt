People in Mexico and Hawaii are preparing for a total eclipse to occur
on July 11.  On the island of Hawaii, 46,000 tourists are expected.
Six observatories on Mauna Kea will focus telescopes on the sun's
outer atmosphere.  Crowds of Californians are expected in Baja
California, where the totality will last the longest--up to 7 minutes.
This is the longest lasting eclipse until 2132. Some Mexicans consider
eclipses a bad omen and are taking precautions such as acquiring
garlic bulbs, magnets or old copper coins.  People are being warned
not to look directly at the sun without eye protection.
