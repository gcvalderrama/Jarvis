William Jefferson Clinton started life deprived of a father who died
before his birth and a mother away at nursing school.  Raised by his
grandmother, he could read and count by the age of three.  He excelled
all through school, winning honor after honor.  Later he went to
Georgetown, to Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar and to Yale Law School.

Returning to Arkansas, anxious to improve his backward state, he was
elected governor at the age of 32. He was defeated at the next
election, but subsequently reelected four times.

Clinton's successes as governor include increased funding for schools
and higher standards of education.
