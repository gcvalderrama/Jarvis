Yesterday the Senate confirmed Judge Thomas by a narrow 52 to 48 vote.
There is much speculation as to how the excruciating ordeal of the
hearings might affect the decisions of the associate justice
concerning such issues as abortion, sexual harassment, separation of
powers, free press, and the rights of accused.  A conservative legal
commentator who earlier supported the nominee now says the Senate
should have rejected Thomas since the accusations against him were not
disproved and the Supreme Court must be above suspicion. Thomas
himself told the Judiciary Committee that nothing could give him back
his good name.
