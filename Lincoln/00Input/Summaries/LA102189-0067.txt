At the Paris meeting of the 39 Antarctica Treaty nations, Australia
and France proposed that Antarctica be turned into a wilderness park
and that the Minerals Convention of 1988, which took six years to
negotiate be scrapped.  Britain and the United States refused to
discuss this proposal and insisted upon implementing the convention,
which creates a framework for mining under strict environmental
guidelines, by discussing clauses that would apportion liability in
the case of mining pollution.  Both side refused to compromise by
would not destroy the 30 year old Antarctic Treaty by walking out.
Another two meetings will be held in Chile next year.
