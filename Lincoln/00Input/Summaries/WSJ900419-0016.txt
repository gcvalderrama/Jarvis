A new cancer drug called 2-CdA proved nearly 100% effective treating
12 patients with hairy cell leukemia.  The patients underwent just a
seven day treatment and suffered almost none of the usual debilitating
side effects associated with chemotherapy, yet, they have been
disease free for four years.  Results must be replicated by other
researchers before definitive conclusions can be made.  The drug is
easy to produce and likely to be less expensive.  Dr. Lawrence Piro of
the Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation said it has also been used
effectively in initial trials to treat more common forms of leukemia.
