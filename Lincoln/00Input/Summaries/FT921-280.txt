A minimum wage is a convenient way for a left-of-center government to
appear to be doing something about poverty.  But Tories believe that
would be harmful.  No-one knows whether or how a statutory minimum
would affect unskilled wages and employment in the UK.  International
evidence is a source of clues as to how a minimum wage would affect
unskilled wages and employment.  A survey of fast food restaurants in
the US, which has a large and competitive service sector paying low
wages, showed that over half had to raise wages to meet the minimum.
But the survey contradicts the view that raising the minimum prices
people out of jobs.
