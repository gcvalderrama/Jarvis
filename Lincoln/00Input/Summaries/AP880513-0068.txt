Earthquake-force blasts on May 4th leveled a Nevada Kerr-McGee plant
that makes ammonium perchlorate, a component of space shuttle and
military rocket fuel. Two people were killed, 326 injured, and an
estimated $73 million in damage done. The plant says a pre-explosion
30-minute leak in a large natural gas line passing through the plant
ignited at the point of origin from circumstances unrelated to plant
operations. Southwest Gas said the line ruptured after the
explosions. The plant is the sole US manufacturer of ammonium
perchlorate. The state ordered production halted while the explosion
is investigated, which could delay the space shuttle program.
