Plans to build a 5,000-room resort in Las Vegas would allow the city
to claim the eight largest hotels in the world by 1992 if other cities
do not build big hotels by 1992.

The Las Vegas Hilton has 3,174 rooms.  When the Flamingo Hilton
completes an expansion next March it will have 3,530 rooms. When the
Excalibur is completed next summer it will have 4,032 rooms and the
Mirage will opens next month with 3,054 rooms.

The Hilton Hawaiian Village Hotel in Honolulu with 2,525 rooms makes
it the largest hotel in number of rooms outside of Las Vegas.
