The candidate backed by Mikhail Gorbachev for President of the Russian
Republic, Russian Aleksandr Vlasov, withdrew from the race today,
strengthening the campaign of Boris Yeltsin, the populist who has
repeatedly clashed with Gorbachev.  Two other men remained in the race
but the contest appeared to be between Yeltsin and Vlasov.  Earlier,
Yeltsin delivered a speech pledging to defend the republic from
meddling by the national Soviet government but refrained from clashing
with Gorbachev.  Gorbachev holds the posts of President of the USSR
and General Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party, the two most
powerful jobs in the Soviet Union.
