Boris Yeltsin, the new president of the Russian Federation and a
leading critic of Mikhail Gorbachev, said Thursday he will try to make
peace in his personal feud with the Soviet president.  Wednesday,
Yeltsin called for achieving Russian "sovereignty" within 100 days,
meaning with this term not independence but autonomy in most internal
decisions.  Yeltsin also urged the Kremlin to allow the other 14
republics the same autonomy, making the country a federation of states
that could overrule the central government on most matters.  Yeltsin
was accused by a Russian Congress deputy of overstepping his authority
with some of his statements.
