Russian lawmakers cast ballots Friday night in a vote to determine
whether populist Boris N. Yeltsin would become President of the Soviet
Union's largest republic.  He needs backing from 531 of the 1,059
members of the Russian Congress.  A Yeltsin victory would mean an
important setback for Gorbachev who spoke out against Yeltsin's plan
for increased Russian autonomy.

Yeltsin has made a remarkable political comeback from disgrace two
years ago when he was ousted from his post as Moscow Party Chief.
Ostracized by the Kremlin elite, including Gorbachev, he has continued
to publicly criticize Gorbachev for his "halfway reforms."
