Senators McClure (R) and Metzenbaum (D) have sponsored bills to
prevent plastic guns from slipping through airport security.  The gun,
not yet manufactured, is intended for military and police use.

Metzenbaum's bill would require some detectable metal content;
McClure's would require more sensitive detection equipment at
airports, almost certainly causing passenger delays.

The NRA opposes "the first federal gun ban bill in America," and warns
members their guns will soon be inspected and weighed by government
agents.

However, on this issue they will compromise, not to ban the gun, but
to increase airport security.  Handgun control advocates and law
enforcement officials back Metzenbaum's proposal.
