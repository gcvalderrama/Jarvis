The Reagan Administration may relax its opposition to an increase in
the minimum wage if Congress agrees to dilute the legislation
significantly.  Labor Secretary Brock says it must exempt youths
lacking entry-level job skills and drop plans for future raises.
Brock said that a number of people are not only unemployed but
unemployable and that increasing the wage would add to the problem.
Rep Hawkins said that if Brock put his ideas into a bill it would be
given a hearing.  But, he said, it's too early to talk compromise.  An
aide to a Republican Senator said that many people feel that an
increase in the wage is inevitable.
