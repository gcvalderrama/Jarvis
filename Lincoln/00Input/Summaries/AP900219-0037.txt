A natural-gas leak caused an explosion early Sunday at a three-story
Super 8 Motel in Hagerstown. A guest told the night clerk gas was
leaking from the laundry room area.  The gas company told the clerk to
turn the gas off, which he was attempting when the explosion
occurred. He pulled the alarm and called 911. Guests jumped from
windows and lowered themselves using bedsheets. Four were killed and
ten treated for smoke inhalation and minor injuries. The explosion
threw debris 300 feet and blew out the building's front. The fire
couldn't be put out until the gas line was shut off.
