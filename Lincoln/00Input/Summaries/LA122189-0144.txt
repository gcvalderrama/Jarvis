Eruption of Costa Rica's Poas volcano in April and May was preceded by
two years of increasing gravity, thought to result from the intrusion
of subsurface magma into the volcanic cone. After Poas's last eruption
in 1953, lake depth stayed the same until 1983 when it began
decreasing as heating magma caused water to evaporate. Erupting water
geysers in June 1987 brought levels down faster and water was gone by
April 1989 when Poas erupted in a mile-high cloud of ash. Eruptions
subsided when rains refilled the lake.  Guatemala's Pacayo volcano,
which erupted 10 years ago, has a different gravity change pattern.
