Clarence Thomas, black nominee to the Supreme Court, comes from a
childhood in segregated Georgia where he was taught the ethic of hard
work, self discipline, and independence. He went north to college at
Holy Cross. By the time he entered Yale Law School he was described as
a freewheeling liberal. Brilliant conservative law professors and the
writings of a conservative black economist had a profound influence on
Thomas.  In his service in various state and federal positions and on
the U.S. Court of Appeals he has been a proponent of personal strength
over dependence and individualism over government activism.
