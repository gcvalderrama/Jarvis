Separate interviews were conducted on Hong Kong TV with Lu Ping,
director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office of the State
Council of the PRC and with Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten.  Both
gentlemen tended to fault the other for lack of cooperation. Lu Ping
promotes the Preliminary Working Group and asserts that Patten has
closed the door on Hong Kong civil servants meeting with the PWG.
Patten says that the PWG is China's creation and that the Joint
Liaison Group is the treaty established forum.  Points of contention
have been the Hong Kong airport construction and the Kowloon-Canton
Railway.
