An editorial in the San Jose Mercury News by Representative Les AuCoin
explains why he no longer votes the NRA line.  Following is a brief
summary of his thoughts:

AuCoin notes that crime has increased since his election; with 50,000
gun deaths since the Brady Bill was first proposed.  The streets are
dangerous, he feels, with increased crime and gang activity.  This has
convinced him to abandon the NRA line and support the Brady Bill.
AuCoin says that Oregon is no longer an island.

AuCoin believes his constituents are less concerned by a waiting
period than about the increasing gun violence.
