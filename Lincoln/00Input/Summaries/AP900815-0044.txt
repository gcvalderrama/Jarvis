Saddam Hussein, facing opposition troops at the Saudi border, today
sought peace with neighboring Iran.  Meanwhile, the Soviet Union
attempts mediation efforts with other Arab states.  Jordan's King
Hussein, carrying a message from Saddam, will meet with President Bush
on Thursday.  And the U.S. military buildup continues at a feverish
pace.  Cheney may urge Bush to call up the armed forces reserves.
Soviet women, children and invalids caught in Iraq are allowed to
leave through Jordan; however, approximately 3000 U.S. citizens may
not.  There have been reports of wholesale Iraqi looting in Kuwait.
And last, oil prices have risen steeply.
