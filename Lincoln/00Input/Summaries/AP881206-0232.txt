Jerry Sickmeier and Lisa Jines were critically injured in a
natural-gas explosion in their suburban St. Louis home Dec 7,
1986. Both sustained burns on 80% of their bodies and haven't worked
since the explosion. They alleged Illinois Power was negligent in
allowing a natural-gas pipe to deteriorate until it ruptured. Gas from
the pipe traveled through sewer lines into the home's utility room and
was ignited by the hot-water heater pilot light. The explosion
occurred as police were awakening and evacuating area
residents. Illinois Power agreed the day the trial was to begin to pay
the couple $11.5 million.
