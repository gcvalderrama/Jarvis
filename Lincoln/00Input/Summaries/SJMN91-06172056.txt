John Sununu, the abrasive White House Chief of Staff, is discovering
that the many people he has insulted or slighted are enjoying his
recent travails and asking how long he will last in his job. Sununu's
brusque style has alienated Republicans and Democrats alike. The
latest flap over his using a government limousine to go to a stamp
auction in New York raises no legal question, but makes one question,
his judgment. President Bush said that Sununu's job was safe but
Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater made it clear that Bush
directed Sununu to make no more embarrassing trips.
