Black residents in Los Angeles say that the widely publicized King
beating is not news.  Joe Hicks of the ACLU says it happens all the
time.

Rodney King, a black man, was stopped by California Highway patrolmen
and Los Angeles police after a high speed chase. Unresisting, he was
beaten by several officers with night sticks as others stood by.  The
incident was videotaped by a witness, who passed the tape along to
media.

Police claim King resisted arrest; witnesses deny this.

Police misconduct reports rose 75 percent this year, ranging from
illegal search and seizure to death.
