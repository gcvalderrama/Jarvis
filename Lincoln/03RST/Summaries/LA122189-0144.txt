british researcher have find ' the first unambiguous evidence ' that small change in gravity can precede a volcanic eruption 
as a result, most study have measure microgravity change only at long intervals, often simply before and after a volcanic eruption, and the result have be open to various interpretation 
in a article publish today in the journal Nature the researcher report 
the Rymer and Brown study, 
' represent the first time Brown can see a progression in microgravity over a long period of time ' so that the result be much
